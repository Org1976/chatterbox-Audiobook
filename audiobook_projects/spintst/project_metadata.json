And what she did remember she couldn’t talk about, or the psychtechs would know she’d been hacking her own memory.\n\nBut that was later. After the court martial. After jump fade and the rehab tanks had stolen it from her. Before that the memory was still crisp and clear and unedited. Still hers.\n\nAfter all, she’d been there.\n",
