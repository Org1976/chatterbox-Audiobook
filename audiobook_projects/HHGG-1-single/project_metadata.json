  "text_content": "The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy .\n By Douglas Adams, read by Will Wheaton. \n \nfor Jonny Brock and Clare Gorst\nand all other Arlingtoniansfor tea, sympathy, and a sofa.\n\n\n\nFar out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of\nthe western spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a small unregarded\nyellow sun.\n\nOrbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety two million miles\nis an utterly insignificant little blue green planet whose ape \ndescended life forms are so amazingly primitive that they still\nthink digital watches are a pretty neat idea.\n\nThis planet has or rather had a problem, which was this: most\nof the people on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time.\nMany solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of these\nwere largely concerned with the movements of small green pieces\nof paper, which is odd because on the whole it wasn't the small\ngreen pieces of paper that were unhappy.\n\nAnd so the problem remained; lots of the people were mean, and\nmost of them were miserable, even the ones with digital watches.\n\nMany were increasingly of the opinion that they'd all made a big\nmistake in coming down from the trees in the first place. And\nsome said that even the trees had been a bad move, and that no\none should ever have left the oceans.\n\nAnd then, one Thursday, nearly two thousand years after one man\nhad been nailed to a tree for saying how great it would be to be\nnice to people for a change, one girl sitting on her own in a\nsmall cafe in Rickmansworth suddenly realized what it was that\nhad been going wrong all this time, and she finally knew how the\nworld could be made a good and happy place. This time it was\nright, it would work, and no one would have to get nailed to\nanything.\n\nSadly, however, before she could get to a phone to tell anyone \nabout it, a terribly stupid catastrophe occurred, and the idea\nwas lost forever.\n\nThis is not her story.\n\nBut it is the story of that terrible stupid catastrophe and some\nof its consequences.\n\nIt is also the story of a book, a book called The Hitch Hiker's\nGuide to the Galaxy not an Earth book, never published on\nEarth, and until the terrible catastrophe occurred, never seen or\nheard of by any Earthman.\n\nNevertheless, a wholly remarkable book.\n\nin fact it was probably the most remarkable book ever to come out\nof the great publishing houses of Ursa Minor of which no\nEarthman had ever heard either.\n\nNot only is it a wholly remarkable book, it is also a highly\nsuccessful one more popular than the Celestial Home Care\nOmnibus, better selling than Fifty More Things to do in Zero\nGravity, and more controversial than Oolon Colluphid's trilogy of\nphilosophical blockbusters Where God Went Wrong, Some More of\nGod's Greatest Mistakes and Who is this God Person Anyway?\n\nIn many of the more relaxed civilizations on the Outer Eastern\nRim of the Galaxy, the Hitch Hiker's Guide has already supplanted\nthe great Encyclopedia Galactica as the standard repository of\nall knowledge and wisdom, for though it has many omissions and\ncontains much that is apocryphal, or at least wildly inaccurate,\nit scores over the older, more pedestrian work in two important\nrespects.\n\nFirst, it is slightly cheaper; and secondly it has the words\nDon't Panic inscribed in large friendly letters on its cover.\n\nBut the story of this terrible, stupid Thursday, the story of its\nextraordinary consequences, and the story of how these\nconsequences are inextricably intertwined with this remarkable\nbook begins very simply.\n\nIt begins with a house.\n\n\n\nThe house stood on a slight rise just on the edge of the village.\nIt stood on its own and looked over a broad spread of West\nCountry farmland. Not a remarkable house by any means it was\nabout thirty years old, squattish, squarish, made of brick, and\nhad four windows set in the front of a size and proportion which\nmore or less exactly failed to please the eye.\n\nThe only person for whom the house was in any way special was\nArthur Dent, and that was only because it happened to be the one\nhe lived in. He had lived in it for about three years, ever since\nhe had moved out of London because it made him nervous and\nirritable. He was about thirty as well, dark haired and never \nquite at ease with himself. The thing that used to worry him most\nwas the fact that people always used to ask him what he was\nlooking so worried about. He worked in local radio which he\nalways used to tell his friends was a lot more interesting than\nthey probably thought. It was, too most of his friends worked\nin advertising.\n\nIt hadn't properly registered with Arthur that the council wanted\nto knock down his house and build an bypass instead.\n\nAt eight o'clock on Thursday morning Arthur didn't feel very\ngood. He woke up blearily, got up, wandered blearily round his\nroom, opened a window, saw a bulldozer, found his slippers, and\nstomped off to the bathroom to wash.\n\nToothpaste on the brush so. Scrub.\n\nShaving mirror pointing at the ceiling. He adjusted it. For a\nmoment it reflected a second bulldozer through the bathroom\nwindow. Properly adjusted, it reflected Arthur Dent's bristles.\nHe shaved them off, washed, dried, and stomped off to the kitchen\nto find something pleasant to put in his mouth.\n\nKettle, plug, fridge, milk, coffee. Yawn.\n\nThe word bulldozer wandered through his mind for a moment in\nsearch of something to connect with.\n\nThe bulldozer outside the kitchen window was quite a big one.\n\nHe stared at it.\n\n\"Yellow\" he thought and stomped off back to his bedroom to get\ndressed.\n\nPassing the bathroom he stopped to drink a large glass of water,\nand another. He began to suspect that he was hung over. Why was\nhe hung over? Had he been drinking the night before? He supposed\nthat he must have been. He caught a glint in the shaving mirror.\n\"Yellow\" he thought and stomped on to the bedroom.\n\nHe stood and thought. The pub, he thought. Oh dear, the pub. He\nvaguely remembered being angry, angry about something that seemed\nimportant. He'd been telling people about it, telling people\nabout it at great length, he rather suspected: his clearest\nvisual recollection was of glazed looks on other people's faces.\nSomething about a new bypass he had just found out about. It had\nbeen in the pipeline for months only no one seemed to have known\nabout it. Ridiculous. He took a swig of water. It would sort\nitself out, he'd decided, no one wanted a bypass, the council\ndidn't have a leg to stand on. It would sort itself out.\n\nGod what a terrible hangover it had earned him though. He looked\nat himself in the wardrobe mirror. He stuck out his tongue.\n\"Yellow\" he thought. The word yellow wandered through his mind\nin search of something to connect with.\n\nFifteen seconds later he was out of the house and lying in front\nof a big yellow bulldozer that was advancing up his garden path.\nMr L Prosser was, as they say, only human. In other words he was\na carbon based life form descended from an ape. More specifically\nhe was forty, fat and shabby and worked for the local council.\nCuriously enough, though he didn't know it, he was also a direct\nmale line descendant of Genghis Khan, though intervening\ngenerations and racial mixing had so juggled his genes that he\nhad no discernible Mongoloid characteristics, and the only\nvestiges left in Mr L Prosser of his mighty ancestry were a\npronounced stoutness about the tum and a predilection for little\nfur hats.\n\nHe was by no means a great warrior: in fact he was a nervous\nworried man. Today he was particularly nervous and worried\nbecause something had gone seriously wrong with his job which\nwas to see that Arthur Dent's house got cleared out of the way\nbefore the day was out.\n\n\"Come off it, Mr Dent\", he said, \"you can't win you know. You\ncan't lie in front of the bulldozer indefinitely\" He tried to\nmake his eyes blaze fiercely but they just wouldn't do it.\n\nArthur lay in the mud and squelched at him.\n\n\"I'm game\" he said, \"we'll see who rusts first\"\n\n\"I'm afraid you're going to have to accept it\" said Mr Prosser\ngripping his fur hat and rolling it round the top of his head,\n\"this bypass has got to be built and it's going to be built!\"\n\n\"First I've heard of it\" said Arthur, \"why's it going to be\nbuilt?\"\n\nMr Prosser shook his finger at him for a bit, then stopped and\nput it away again.\n\n\"What do you mean, why's it got to be built?\" he said. \"It's a\nbypass. You've got to build bypasses\"\n\nBypasses are devices which allow some people to drive from point\nA to point B very fast whilst other people dash from point B to\npoint A very fast. People living at point C, being a point\ndirectly in between, are often given to wonder what's so great\nabout point A that so many people of point B are so keen to get\nthere, and what's so great about point B that so many people of\npoint A are so keen to get there. They often wish that people\nwould just once and for all work out where the hell they wanted\nto be.\n\nMr Prosser wanted to be at point D. Point D wasn't anywhere in\nparticular, it was just any convenient point a very long way from\npoints A, B and C. He would have a nice little cottage at point\nD, with axes over the door, and spend a pleasant amount of time\nat point E, which would be the nearest pub to point D. His wife\nof course wanted climbing roses, but he wanted axes. He didn't\nknow why he just liked axes. He flushed hotly under the\nderisive grins of the bulldozer drivers.\n\nHe shifted his weight from foot to foot, but it was equally\nuncomfortable on each. Obviously somebody had been appallingly\nincompetent and he hoped to God it wasn't him.\n\nMr Prosser said: \"You were quite entitled to make any suggestions\nor protests at the appropriate time you know\"\n\n\"Appropriate time?\" hooted Arthur. \"Appropriate time? The first I\nknew about it was when a workman arrived at my home yesterday. I\nasked him if he'd come to clean the windows and he said no he'd\ncome to demolish the house. He didn't tell me straight away of\ncourse. Oh no. First he wiped a couple of windows and charged me\na fiver. Then he told me\"\n\n\"But Mr Dent, the plans have been available in the local planning\noffice for the last nine month\"\n\n\"Oh yes, well as soon as I heard I went straight round to see\nthem, yesterday afternoon. You hadn't exactly gone out of your\nway to call attention to them had you? I mean like actually\ntelling anybody or anything\"\n\n\"But the plans were on display ..\"\n\n\"On display? I eventually had to go down to the cellar to find\nthem\"\n\n\"That's the display department\"\n\n\"With a torch\"\n\n\"Ah, well the lights had probably gone\"\n\n\"So had the stairs\"\n\n\"But look, you found the notice didn't you?\"\n\n\"Yes\" said Arthur, \"yes I did. It was on display in the bottom\nof a locked filing cabinet stuck in a disused lavatory with a\nsign on the door saying Beware of the Leopard\"\n\nA cloud passed overhead. It cast a shadow over Arthur Dent as he\nlay propped up on his elbow in the cold mud. It cast a shadow\nover Arthur Dent's house. Mr Prosser frowned at it.\n\n\"It's not as if it's a particularly nice house\" he said.\n\n\"I'm sorry, but I happen to like it\"\n\n\"You'll like the bypass\"\n\n\"Oh shut up\" said Arthur Dent. \"Shut up and go away, and take\nyour bloody bypass with you. You haven't got a leg to stand on\nand you know it\"\n\nMr Prosser's mouth opened and closed a couple of times while his\nmind was for a moment filled with inexplicable but terribly\nattractive visions of Arthur Dent's house being consumed with\nfire and Arthur himself running screaming from the blazing ruin\nwith at least three hefty spears protruding from his back. Mr\nProsser was often bothered with visions like these and they made\nhim feel very nervous. He stuttered for a moment and then pulled\nhimself together.\n\n\"Mr Dent\" he said.\n\n\"Hello? Yes?\" said Arthur.\n\n\"Some factual information for you. Have you any idea how much\ndamage that bulldozer would suffer if I just let it roll straight\nover you?\"\n\n\"How much?\" said Arthur.\n\n\"None at all\" said Mr Prosser, and stormed nervously off\nwondering why his brain was filled with a thousand hairy horsemen\nall shouting at him.\n\nBy a curious coincidence, None at all is exactly how much\nsuspicion the ape descendant Arthur Dent had that one of his\nclosest friends was not descended from an ape, but was in fact\nfrom a small planet in the vicinity of Betelgeuse and not from\nGuildford as he usually claimed.\n\nArthur Dent had never, ever suspected this.\n\nThis friend of his had first arrived on the planet some fifteen\nEarth years previously, and he had worked hard to blend himself\ninto Earth society with, it must be said, some success. For\ninstance he had spent those fifteen years pretending to be an out\nof work actor, which was plausible enough.\n\nHe had made one careless blunder though, because he had skimped a\nbit on his preparatory research. The information he had gathered\nhad led him to choose the name \"Ford Prefect\" as being nicely\ninconspicuous.\n\nHe was not conspicuously tall, his features were striking but not\nconspicuously handsome. His hair was wiry and gingerish and\nbrushed backwards from the temples. His skin seemed to be pulled\nbackwards from the nose. There was something very slightly odd\nabout him, but it was difficult to say what it was. Perhaps it\nwas that his eyes didn't blink often enough and when you talked\nto him for any length of time your eyes began involuntarily to\nwater on his behalf. Perhaps it was that he smiled slightly too\nbroadly and gave people the unnerving impression that he was\nabout to go for their neck.\n\nHe struck most of the friends he had made on Earth as an\neccentric, but a harmless one an unruly boozer with some\noddish habits. For instance he would often gatecrash university\nparties, get badly drunk and start making fun of any\nastrophysicist he could find till he got thrown out.\n\nSometimes he would get seized with oddly distracted moods and\nstare into the sky as if hypnotized until someone asked him what\nhe was doing. Then he would start guiltily for a moment, relax\nand grin.\n\"Oh, just looking for flying saucers\" he would joke and everyone\nwould laugh and ask him what sort of flying saucers he was\nlooking for.\n\n\"Green ones!\" he would reply with a wicked grin, laugh wildly for\na moment and then suddenly lunge for the nearest bar and buy an\nenormous round of drinks.\n\nEvenings like this usually ended badly. Ford would get out of his\nskull on whisky, huddle into a corner with some girl and explain\nto her in slurred phrases that honestly the colour of the flying\nsaucers didn't matter that much really.\n\nThereafter, staggering semi paralytic down the night streets he\nwould often ask passing policemen if they knew the way to\nBetelgeuse. The policemen would usually say something like,\n\"Don't you think it's about time you went off home sir?\"\n\n\"I'm trying to baby, I'm trying to\" is what Ford invariably\nreplied on these occasions.\n\nIn fact what he was really looking out for when he stared\ndistractedly into the night sky was any kind of flying saucer at\nall. The reason he said green was that green was the traditional\nspace livery of the Betelgeuse trading scouts.\n\nFord Prefect was desperate that any flying saucer at all would\narrive soon because fifteen years was a long time to get stranded\nanywhere, particularly somewhere as mindboggingly dull as the\nEarth.\n\nFord wished that a flying saucer would arrive soon because he\nknew how to flag flying saucers down and get lifts from them. He\nknew how to see the Marvels of the Universe for less than thirty\nAltairan dollars a day.\n\nIn fact, Ford Prefect was a roving researcher for that wholly\nremarkable book The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy.\n\nHuman beings are great adaptors, and by lunchtime life in the\nenvirons of Arthur's house had settled into a steady routine. It\nwas Arthur's accepted role to lie squelching in the mud making\noccasional demands to see his lawyer, his mother or a good book;\nit was Mr Prosser's accepted role to tackle Arthur with the\noccasional new ploy such as the For the Public Good talk, the\nMarch of Progress talk, the They Knocked My House Down Once You\nKnow, Never Looked Back talk and various other cajoleries and\nthreats; and it was the bulldozer drivers' accepted role to sit\naround drinking coffee and experimenting with union regulations\nto see how they could turn the situation to their financial\nadvantage.\n\nThe Earth moved slowly in its diurnal course.\n\nThe sun was beginning to dry out the mud Arthur lay in.\n\nA shadow moved across him again.\n\n\"Hello Arthur\" said the shadow.\nArthur looked up and squinting into the sun was startled to see\nFord Prefect standing above him.\n\n\"Ford! Hello, how are you?\"\n\n\"Fine\" said Ford, \"look, are you busy?\"\n\n\"Am I busy?\" exclaimed Arthur. \"Well, I've just got all these\nbulldozers and things to lie in front of because they'll knock my\nhouse down if I don't, but other than that ... well, no not\nespecially, why?\"\n\nThey don't have sarcasm on Betelgeuse, and Ford Prefect often\nfailed to notice it unless he was concentrating. He said, \"Good,\nis there anywhere we can talk?\"\n\n\"What?\" said Arthur Dent.\n\nFor a few seconds Ford seemed to ignore him, and stared fixedly\ninto the sky like a rabbit trying to get run over by a car. Then\nsuddenly he squatted down beside Arthur.\n\n\"We've got to talk\" he said urgently.\n\n\"Fine\" said Arthur, \"talk\"\n\n\"And drink\" said Ford. \"It's vitally important that we talk and\ndrink. Now. We'll go to the pub in the village\"\n\nHe looked into the sky again, nervous, expectant.\n\n\"Look, don't you understand?\" shouted Arthur. He pointed at\nProsser. \"That man wants to knock my house down!\"\n\nFord glanced at him, puzzled.\n\n\"Well he can do it while you're away can't he?\" he asked.\n\n\"But I don't want him to!\"\n\n\"Ah\"\n\n\"Look, what's the matter with you Ford?\" said Arthur.\n\n\"Nothing. Nothing's the matter. Listen to me I've got to tell\nyou the most important thing you've ever heard. I've got to tell\nyou now, and I've got to tell you in the saloon bar of the Horse\nand Groom\"\n\n\"But why?\"\n\n\"Because you are going to need a very stiff drink\"\n\nFord stared at Arthur, and Arthur was astonished to find that his\nwill was beginning to weaken. He didn't realize that this was\nbecause of an old drinking game that Ford learned to play in the\nhyperspace ports that served the madranite mining belts in the\nstar system of Orion Beta.\nThe game was not unlike the Earth game called Indian Wrestling,\nand was played like this:\n\nTwo contestants would sit either side of a table, with a glass in\nfront of each of them.\n\nBetween them would be placed a bottle of Janx Spirit (as\nimmortalized in that ancient Orion mining song \"Oh don't give me\nnone more of that Old Janx Spirit/ No, don't you give me none\nmore of that Old Janx Spirit/ For my head will fly, my tongue\nwill lie, my eyes will fry and I may die/ Won't you pour me one\nmore of that sinful Old Janx Spirit\").\n\nEach of the two contestants would then concentrate their will on\nthe bottle and attempt to tip it and pour spirit into the glass\nof his opponent who would then have to drink it.\n\nThe bottle would then be refilled. The game would be played\nagain. And again.\n\nOnce you started to lose you would probably keep losing, because\none of the effects of Janx spirit is to depress telepsychic\npower.\n\nAs soon as a predetermined quantity had been consumed, the final\nloser would have to perform a forfeit, which was usually\nobscenely biological.\n\nFord Prefect usually played to lose.\n\nFord stared at Arthur, who began to think that perhaps he did\nwant to go to the Horse and Groom after all.\n\n\"But what about my house ...?\" he asked plaintively.\n\nFord looked across to Mr Prosser, and suddenly a wicked thought\nstruck him.\n\n\"He wants to knock your house down?\"\n\n\"Yes, he wants to build ..\"\n\n\"And he can't because you're lying in front of the bulldozers?\"\n\n\"Yes, and ..\"\n\n\"I'm sure we can come to some arrangement\" said Ford. \"Excuse\nme!\" he shouted.\n\nMr Prosser (who was arguing with a spokesman for the bulldozer\ndrivers about whether or not Arthur Dent constituted a mental\nhealth hazard, and how much they should get paid if he did)\nlooked around. He was surprised and slightly alarmed to find that\nArthur had company.\n\n\"Yes? Hello?\" he called. \"Has Mr Dent come to his senses yet?\"\n\n\"Can we for the moment\" called Ford, \"assume that he hasn't?\"\n\"Well?\" sighed Mr Prosser.\n\n\"And can we also assume\" said Ford, \"that he's going to be\nstaying here all day?\"\n\n\"So?\"\n\n\"So all your men are going to be standing around all day doing\nnothing?\"\n\n\"Could be, could be ..\"\n\n\"Well, if you're resigned to doing that anyway, you don't\nactually need him to lie here all the time do you?\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"You don't\" said Ford patiently, \"actually need him here\"\n\nMr Prosser thought about this.\n\n\"Well no, not as such..\", he said, \"not exactly need ..\"\nProsser was worried. He thought that one of them wasn't making a\nlot of sense.\n\nFord said, \"So if you would just like to take it as read that\nhe's actually here, then he and I could slip off down to the pub\nfor half an hour. How does that sound?\"\n\nMr Prosser thought it sounded perfectly potty.\n\n\"That sounds perfectly reasonable\" he said in a reassuring tone\nof voice, wondering who he was trying to reassure.\n\n\"And if you want to pop off for a quick one yourself later on\"\nsaid Ford, \"we can always cover up for you in return\"\n\n\"Thank you very much\" said Mr Prosser who no longer knew how to\nplay this at all, \"thank you very much, yes, that's very kind\n..\" He frowned, then smiled, then tried to do both at once,\nfailed, grasped hold of his fur hat and rolled it fitfully round\nthe top of his head. He could only assume that he had just won.\n\n\"So\" continued Ford Prefect, \"if you would just like to come\nover here and lie down ..\"\n\n\"What?\" said Mr Prosser.\n\n\"Ah, I'm sorry\" said Ford, \"perhaps I hadn't made myself fully\nclear. Somebody's got to lie in front of the bulldozers haven't\nthey? Or there won't be anything to stop them driving into Mr\nDent's house will there?\"\n\n\"What?\" said Mr Prosser again.\n\n\"It's very simple\" said Ford, \"my client, Mr Dent, says that he\nwill stop lying here in the mud on the sole condition that you\ncome and take over from him\"\n\"What are you talking about?\" said Arthur, but Ford nudged him\nwith his shoe to be quiet.\n\n\"You want me\" said Mr Prosser, spelling out this new thought to\nhimself, \"to come and lie there ..\"\n\n\"Yes\"\n\n\"In front of the bulldozer?\"\n\n\"Yes\"\n\n\"Instead of Mr Dent\"\n\n\"Yes\"\n\n\"In the mud\"\n\n\"In, as you say it, the mud\"\n\nAs soon as Mr Prosser realized that he was substantially the\nloser after all, it was as if a weight lifted itself off his\nshoulders: this was more like the world as he knew it. He sighed.\n\n\"In return for which you will take Mr Dent with you down to the\npub?\"\n\n\"That's it\" said Ford. \"That's it exactly\"\n\nMr Prosser took a few nervous steps forward and stopped.\n\n\"Promise?\"\n\n\"Promise\" said Ford. He turned to Arthur.\n\n\"Come on\" he said to him, \"get up and let the man lie down\"\n\nArthur stood up, feeling as if he was in a dream.\n\nFord beckoned to Prosser who sadly, awkwardly, sat down in the\nmud. He felt that his whole life was some kind of dream and he\nsometimes wondered whose it was and whether they were enjoying\nit. The mud folded itself round his bottom and his arms and oozed\ninto his shoes.\n\nFord looked at him severely.\n\n\"And no sneaky knocking down Mr Dent's house whilst he's away,\nalright?\" he said.\n\n\"The mere thought\" growled Mr Prosser, \"hadn't even begun to\nspeculate\" he continued, settling himself back, \"about the\nmerest possibility of crossing my mind\"\n\nHe saw the bulldozer driver's union representative approaching\nand let his head sink back and closed his eyes. He was trying to\nmarshal his arguments for proving that he did not now constitute\na mental health hazard himself. He was far from certain about\nthis his mind seemed to be full of noise, horses, smoke, and\nthe stench of blood. This always happened when he felt miserable\nand put upon, and he had never been able to explain it to\nhimself. In a high dimension of which we know nothing the mighty\nKhan bellowed with rage, but Mr Prosser only trembled slightly\nand whimpered. He began to fell little pricks of water behind the\neyelids. Bureaucratic cock ups, angry men lying in the mud,\nindecipherable strangers handing out inexplicable humiliations\nand an unidentified army of horsemen laughing at him in his head\n what a day.\n\nWhat a day. Ford Prefect knew that it didn't matter a pair of\ndingo's kidneys whether Arthur's house got knocked down or not\nnow.\n\nArthur remained very worried.\n\n\"But can we trust him?\" he said.\n\n\"Myself I'd trust him to the end of the Earth\" said Ford.\n\n\"Oh yes\" said Arthur, \"and how far's that?\"\n\n\"About twelve minutes away\" said Ford, \"come on, I need a\ndrink\"\n\n\n\n\nHere's what the Encyclopedia Galactica has to say about alcohol.\nIt says that alcohol is a colourless volatile liquid formed by\nthe fermentation of sugars and also notes its intoxicating effect\non certain carbon based life forms.\n\nThe Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy also mentions alcohol. It\nsays that the best drink in existence is the Pan Galactic Gargle\nBlaster.\n\nIt says that the effect of a Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster is like\nhaving your brains smashed out by a slice of lemon wrapped round\na large gold brick.\n\nThe Guide also tells you on which planets the best Pan Galactic\nGargle Blasters are mixed, how much you can expect to pay for one\nand what voluntary organizations exist to help you rehabilitate\nafterwards.\n\nThe Guide even tells you how you can mix one yourself.\n\nTake the juice from one bottle of that Ol' Janx Spirit, it says.\n\nPour into it one measure of water from the seas of Santraginus V\n Oh that Santraginean sea water, it says. Oh those Santraginean\nfish!!!\n\nAllow three cubes of Arcturan Mega gin to melt into the mixture\n(it must be properly iced or the benzine is lost).\n\nAllow four litres of Fallian marsh gas to bubble through it, in\nmemory of all those happy Hikers who have died of pleasure in the\nMarshes of Fallia.\n\nOver the back of a silver spoon float a measure of Qualactin\nHypermint extract, redolent of all the heady odours of the dark\nQualactin Zones, subtle sweet and mystic.\n\nDrop in the tooth of an Algolian Suntiger. Watch it dissolve,\nspreading the fires of the Algolian Suns deep into the heart of\nthe drink.\n\nSprinkle Zamphuor.\n\nAdd an olive.\n\nDrink ... but ... very carefully ...\n\nThe Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy sells rather better than\nthe Encyclopedia Galactica.\n\n\"Six pints of bitter\" said Ford Prefect to the barman of the\nHorse and Groom. \"And quickly please, the world's about to end\"\n\nThe barman of the Horse and Groom didn't deserve this sort of\ntreatment, he was a dignified old man. He pushed his glasses up\nhis nose and blinked at Ford Prefect. Ford ignored him and stared\nout of the window, so the barman looked instead at Arthur who\nshrugged helplessly and said nothing.\n\nSo the barman said, \"Oh yes sir? Nice weather for it\" and\nstarted pulling pints.\n\nHe tried again.\n\n\"Going to watch the match this afternoon then?\"\n\nFord glanced round at him.\n\n\"No, no point\" he said, and looked back out of the window.\n\n\"What's that, foregone conclusion then you reckon sir?\" said the\nbarman. \"Arsenal without a chance?\"\n\n\"No, no\" said Ford, \"it's just that the world's about to end\"\n\n\"Oh yes sir, so you said\" said the barman, looking over his\nglasses this time at Arthur. \"Lucky escape for Arsenal if it\ndid\"\n\nFord looked back at him, genuinely surprised.\n\n\"No, not really\" he said. He frowned.\n\nThe barman breathed in heavily. \"There you are sir, six pints\"\nhe said.\n\nArthur smiled at him wanly and shrugged again. He turned and\nsmiled wanly at the rest of the pub just in case any of them had\nheard what was going on.\nNone of them had, and none of them could understand what he was\nsmiling at them for.\n\nA man sitting next to Ford at the bar looked at the two men,\nlooked at the six pints, did a swift burst of mental arithmetic,\narrived at an answer he liked and grinned a stupid hopeful grin\nat them.\n\n\"Get off\" said Ford, \"They're ours\" giving him a look that\nwould have an Algolian Suntiger get on with what it was doing.\n\nFord slapped a five pound note on the bar. He said, \"Keep the\nchange\"\n\n\"What, from a fiver? Thank you sir\"\n\n\"You've got ten minutes left to spend it\"\n\nThe barman simply decided to walk away for a bit.\n\n\"Ford\" said Arthur, \"would you please tell me what the hell is\ngoing on?\"\n\n\"Drink up\" said Ford, \"you've got three pints to get through\"\n\n\"Three pints?\" said Arthur. \"At lunchtime?\"\n\nThe man next to ford grinned and nodded happily. Ford ignored\nhim. He said, \"Time is an illusion. Lunchtime doubly so\"\n\n\"Very deep\" said Arthur, \"you should send that in to the\nReader's Digest. They've got a page for people like you\"\n\n\"Drink up\"\n\n\"Why three pints all of a sudden?\"\n\n\"Muscle relaxant, you'll need it\"\n\n\"Muscle relaxant?\"\n\n\"Muscle relaxant\"\n\nArthur stared into his beer.\n\n\"Did I do anything wrong today\" he said, \"or has the world\nalways been like this and I've been too wrapped up in myself to\nnotice?\"\n\n\"Alright\" said Ford, \"I'll try to explain. How long have we\nknown each other?\"\n\n\"How long?\" Arthur thought. \"Er, about five years, maybe six\" he\nsaid. \"Most of it seemed to make some sense at the time\"\n\n\"Alright\" said Ford. \"How would you react if I said that I'm not\nfrom Guildford after all, but from a small planet somewhere in\nthe vicinity of Betelgeuse?\"\nArthur shrugged in a so so sort of way.\n\n\"I don't know\" he said, taking a pull of beer. \"Why do you\nthink it's the sort of thing you're likely to say?\"\n\nFord gave up. It really wasn't worth bothering at the moment,\nwhat with the world being about to end. He just said:\n\n\"Drink up\"\n\nHe added, perfectly factually:\n\n\"The world's about to end\"\n\nArthur gave the rest of the pub another wan smile. The rest of\nthe pub frowned at him. A man waved at him to stop smiling at\nthem and mind his own business.\n\n\"This must be Thursday\" said Arthur musing to himself, sinking\nlow over his beer, \"I never could get the hang of Thursdays\"\n\n\n\n\nOn this particular Thursday, something was moving quietly through\nthe ionosphere many miles above the surface of the planet;\nseveral somethings in fact, several dozen huge yellow chunky\nslablike somethings, huge as office buildings, silent as birds.\nThey soared with ease, basking in electromagnetic rays from the\nstar Sol, biding their time, grouping, preparing.\n\nThe planet beneath them was almost perfectly oblivious of their\npresence, which was just how they wanted it for the moment. The\nhuge yellow somethings went unnoticed at Goonhilly, they passed\nover Cape Canaveral without a blip, Woomera and Jodrell Bank\nlooked straight through them which was a pity because it was\nexactly the sort of thing they'd been looking for all these\nyears.\n\nThe only place they registered at all was on a small black device\ncalled a Sub Etha Sens O Matic which winked away quietly to\nitself. It nestled in the darkness inside a leather satchel which\nFord Prefect wore habitually round his neck. The contents of Ford\nPrefect's satchel were quite interesting in fact and would have\nmade any Earth physicist's eyes pop out of his head, which is why\nhe always concealed them by keeping a couple of dog eared scripts\nfor plays he pretended he was auditioning for stuffed in the top.\nBesides the Sub Etha Sens O Matic and the scripts he had an\nElectronic Thumb a short squat black rod, smooth and matt with\na couple of flat switches and dials at one end; he also had a\ndevice which looked rather like a largish electronic calculator.\nThis had about a hundred tiny flat press buttons and a screen\nabout four inches square on which any one of a million \"pages\"\ncould be summoned at a moment's notice. It looked insanely\ncomplicated, and this was one of the reasons why the snug plastic\ncover it fitted into had the words Don't Panic printed on it in\nlarge friendly letters. The other reason was that this device was\nin fact that most remarkable of all books ever to come out of the\ngreat publishing corporations of Ursa Minor The Hitch Hiker's\nGuide to the Galaxy. The reason why it was published in the form\nof a micro sub meson electronic component is that if it were\nprinted in normal book form, an interstellar hitch hiker would\nrequire several inconveniently large buildings to carry it around\nin.\n\nBeneath that in Ford Prefect's satchel were a few biros, a\nnotepad, and a largish bath towel from Marks and Spencer.\n\nThe Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy has a few things to say on\nthe subject of towels.\n\nA towel, it says, is about the most massively useful thing an\ninterstellar hitch hiker can have. Partly it has great practical\nvalue you can wrap it around you for warmth as you bound across\nthe cold moons of Jaglan Beta; you can lie on it on the brilliant\nmarble sanded beaches of Santraginus V, inhaling the heady sea\nvapours; you can sleep under it beneath the stars which shine so\nredly on the desert world of Kakrafoon; use it to sail a mini\nraft down the slow heavy river Moth; wet it for use in hand to \nhand combat; wrap it round your head to ward off noxious fumes or\nto avoid the gaze of the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal (a\nmindboggingly stupid animal, it assumes that if you can't see it,\nit can't see you daft as a bush, but very ravenous); you can\nwave your towel in emergencies as a distress signal, and of\ncourse dry yourself off with it if it still seems to be clean\nenough.\n\nMore importantly, a towel has immense psychological value. For\nsome reason, if a strag (strag: non hitch hiker) discovers that a\nhitch hiker has his towel with him, he will automatically assume\nthat he is also in possession of a toothbrush, face flannel,\nsoap, tin of biscuits, flask, compass, map, ball of string, gnat\nspray, wet weather gear, space suit etc., etc. Furthermore, the\nstrag will then happily lend the hitch hiker any of these or a\ndozen other items that the hitch hiker might accidentally have\n\"lost\". What the strag will think is that any man who can hitch\nthe length and breadth of the galaxy, rough it, slum it, struggle\nagainst terrible odds, win through, and still knows where his\ntowel is is clearly a man to be reckoned with.\n\nHence a phrase which has passed into hitch hiking slang, as in\n\"Hey, you sass that hoopy Ford Prefect? There's a frood who\nreally knows where his towel is\" (Sass: know, be aware of, meet,\nhave sex with; hoopy: really together guy; frood: really\namazingly together guy.)\n\nNestling quietly on top of the towel in Ford Prefect's satchel,\nthe Sub Etha Sens O Matic began to wink more quickly. Miles above\nthe surface of the planet the huge yellow somethings began to fan\nout. At Jodrell Bank, someone decided it was time for a nice\nrelaxing cup of tea.\n\n\"You got a towel with you?\" said Ford Prefect suddenly to Arthur.\n\nArthur, struggling through his third pint, looked round at him.\n\n\"Why? What, no ... should I have?\" He had given up being\nsurprised, there didn't seem to be any point any longer.\n\nFord clicked his tongue in irritation.\n\n\"Drink up\" he urged.\n\nAt that moment the dull sound of a rumbling crash from outside\nfiltered through the low murmur of the pub, through the sound of\nthe jukebox, through the sound of the man next to Ford hiccupping\nover the whisky Ford had eventually bought him.\n\nArthur choked on his beer, leapt to his feet.\n\n\"What's that?\" he yelped.\n\n\"Don't worry\" said Ford, \"they haven't started yet\"\n\n\"Thank God for that\" said Arthur and relaxed.\n\n\"It's probably just your house being knocked down\" said Ford,\ndrowning his last pint.\n\n\"What?\" shouted Arthur. Suddenly Ford's spell was broken. Arthur\nlooked wildly around him and ran to the window.\n\n\"My God they are! They're knocking my house down. What the hell\nam I doing in the pub, Ford?\"\n\n\"It hardly makes any difference at this stage\" said Ford, \"let\nthem have their fun\"\n\n\"Fun?\" yelped Arthur. \"Fun!\" He quickly checked out of the window\nagain that they were talking about the same thing.\n\n\"Damn their fun!\" he hooted and ran out of the pub furiously\nwaving a nearly empty beer glass. He made no friends at all in\nthe pub that lunchtime.\n\n\"Stop, you vandals! You home wreckers!\" bawled Arthur. \"You half\ncrazed Visigoths, stop will you!\"\n\nFord would have to go after him. Turning quickly to the barman he\nasked for four packets of peanuts.\n\n\"There you are sir\" said the barman, slapping the packets on the\nbar, \"twenty eight pence if you'd be so kind\"\n\nFord was very kind he gave the barman another five pound note\nand told him to keep the change. The barman looked at it and then\nlooked at Ford. He suddenly shivered: he experienced a momentary\nsensation that he didn't understand because no one on Earth had\never experienced it before. In moments of great stress, every\nlife form that exists gives out a tiny sublimal signal. This\nsignal simply communicates an exact and almost pathetic sense of\nhow far that being is from the place of his birth. On Earth it is\nnever possible to be further than sixteen thousand miles from\nyour birthplace, which really isn't very far, so such signals are\ntoo minute to be noticed. Ford Prefect was at this moment under\ngreat stress, and he was born 600 light years away in the near\nvicinity of Betelgeuse.\n\nThe barman reeled for a moment, hit by a shocking,\nincomprehensible sense of distance. He didn't know what it meant,\nbut he looked at Ford Prefect with a new sense of respect, almost\nawe.\n\n\"Are you serious, sir?\" he said in a small whisper which had the\neffect of silencing the pub. \"You think the world's going to\nend?\"\n\n\"Yes\" said Ford.\n\n\"But, this afternoon?\"\n\nFord had recovered himself. He was at his flippest.\n\n\"Yes\" he said gaily, \"in less than two minutes I would\nestimate\"\n\nThe barman couldn't believe the conversation he was having, but\nhe couldn't believe the sensation he had just had either.\n\n\"Isn't there anything we can do about it then?\" he said.\n\n\"No, nothing\" said Ford, stuffing the peanuts into his pockets.\n\nSomeone in the hushed bar suddenly laughed raucously at how\nstupid everyone had become.\n\nThe man sitting next to Ford was a bit sozzled by now. His eyes\nwaved their way up to Ford.\n\n\"I thought\" he said, \"that if the world was going to end we were\nmeant to lie down or put a paper bag over our head or something\"\n\n\"If you like, yes\" said Ford.\n\n\"That's what they told us in the army\" said the man, and his\neyes began the long trek back down to his whisky.\n\n\"Will that help?\" asked the barman.\n\n\"No\" said Ford and gave him a friendly smile. \"Excuse me\" he\nsaid, \"I've got to go\" With a wave, he left.\n\nThe pub was silent for a moment longer, and then, embarrassingly\nenough, the man with the raucous laugh did it again. The girl he\nhad dragged along to the pub with him had grown to loathe him\ndearly over the last hour or so, and it would probably have been\na great satisfaction to her to know that in a minute and a half\nor so he would suddenly evaporate into a whiff of hydrogen, ozone\nand carbon monoxide. However, when the moment came she would be\ntoo busy evaporating herself to notice it.\n\nThe barman cleared his throat. He heard himself say:\n\n\"Last orders, please\"\nThe huge yellow machines began to sink downward and to move\nfaster.\n\nFord knew they were there. This wasn't the way he had wanted it.\n\nRunning up the lane, Arthur had nearly reached his house. He\ndidn't notice how cold it had suddenly become, he didn't notice\nthe wind, he didn't notice the sudden irrational squall of rain.\nHe didn't notice anything but the caterpillar bulldozers crawling\nover the rubble that had been his home.\n\n\"You barbarians!\" he yelled. \"I'll sue the council for every\npenny it's got! I'll have you hung, drawn and quartered! And\nwhipped! And boiled ... until ... until ... until you've had\nenough\"\n\nFord was running after him very fast. Very very fast.\n\n\"And then I'll do it again!\" yelled Arthur. \"And when I've\nfinished I will take all the little bits, and I will jump on\nthem!\"\n\nArthur didn't notice that the men were running from the\nbulldozers; he didn't notice that Mr Prosser was staring\nhectically into the sky. What Mr Prosser had noticed was that\nhuge yellow somethings were screaming through the clouds.\nImpossibly huge yellow somethings.\n\n\"And I will carry on jumping on them\" yelled Arthur, still\nrunning, \"until I get blisters, or I can think of anything even\nmore unpleasant to do, and then ..\"\n\nArthur tripped, and fell headlong, rolled and landed flat on his\nback. At last he noticed that something was going on. His finger\nshot upwards.\n\n\"What the hell's that?\" he shrieked.\n\nWhatever it was raced across the sky in monstrous yellowness,\ntore the sky apart with mind buggering noise and leapt off into\nthe distance leaving the gaping air to shut behind it with a bang\nthat drove your ears six feet into your skull.\n\nAnother one followed and did the same thing only louder.\n\nIt's difficult to say exactly what the people on the surface of\nthe planet were doing now, because they didn't really know what\nthey were doing themselves. None of it made a lot of sense \nrunning into houses, running out of houses, howling noiselessly\nat the noise. All around the world city streets exploded with\npeople, cars slewed into each other as the noise fell on them and\nthen rolled off like a tidal wave over hills and valleys, deserts\nand oceans, seeming to flatten everything it hit.\n\nOnly one man stood and watched the sky, stood with terrible\nsadness in his eyes and rubber bungs in his ears. He knew exactly\nwhat was happening and had known ever since his Sub Etha Sens O \nMatic had started winking in the dead of night beside his pillar\nand woken him with a start. It was what he had waited for all\nthese years, but when he had deciphered the signal pattern\nsitting alone in his small dark room a coldness had gripped him\nand squeezed his heart. Of all the races in all of the Galaxy who\ncould have come and said a big hello to planet Earth, he thought,\ndidn't it just have to be the Vogons.\n\nStill he knew what he had to do. As the Vogon craft screamed\nthrough the air high above him he opened his satchel. He threw\naway a copy of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, he\nthrew away a copy of Godspell: He wouldn't need them where he was\ngoing. Everything was ready, everything was prepared.\n\nHe knew where his towel was.\n\nA sudden silence hit the Earth. If anything it was worse than the\nnoise. For a while nothing happened.\n\nThe great ships hung motionless in the air, over every nation on\nEarth. Motionless they hung, huge, heavy, steady in the sky, a\nblasphemy against nature. Many people went straight into shock as\ntheir minds tried to encompass what they were looking at. The\nships hung in the sky in much the same way that bricks don't.\n\nAnd still nothing happened.\n\nThen there was a slight whisper, a sudden spacious whisper of\nopen ambient sound. Every hi fi set in the world, every radio,\nevery television, every cassette recorder, every woofer, every\ntweeter, every mid range driver in the world quietly turned\nitself on.\n\nEvery tin can, every dust bin, every window, every car, every\nwine glass, every sheet of rusty metal became activated as an\nacoustically perfect sounding board.\n\nBefore the Earth passed away it was going to be treated to the\nvery ultimate in sound reproduction, the greatest public address\nsystem ever built. But there was no concert, no music, no\nfanfare, just a simple message.\n\n\"People of Earth, your attention please\" a voice said, and it\nwas wonderful. Wonderful perfect quadrophonic sound with\ndistortion levels so low as to make a brave man weep.\n\n\"This is Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz of the Galactic Hyperspace\nPlanning Council\" the voice continued. \"As you will no doubt be\naware, the plans for development of the outlying regions of the\nGalaxy require the building of a hyperspatial express route\nthrough your star system, and regrettably your planet is one of\nthose scheduled for demolition. The process will take slightly\nless that two of your Earth minutes. Thank you\"\n\nThe PA died away.\n\nUncomprehending terror settled on the watching people of Earth.\nThe terror moved slowly through the gathered crowds as if they\nwere iron fillings on a sheet of board and a magnet was moving\nbeneath them. Panic sprouted again, desperate fleeing panic, but\nthere was nowhere to flee to.\nObserving this, the Vogons turned on their PA again. It said:\n\n\"There's no point in acting all surprised about it. All the\nplanning charts and demolition orders have been on display in\nyour local planning department on Alpha Centauri for fifty of\nyour Earth years, so you've had plenty of time to lodge any\nformal complaint and it's far too late to start making a fuss\nabout it now\"\n\nThe PA fell silent again and its echo drifted off across the\nland. The huge ships turned slowly in the sky with easy power. On\nthe underside of each a hatchway opened, an empty black space.\n\nBy this time somebody somewhere must have manned a radio\ntransmitter, located a wavelength and broadcasted a message back\nto the Vogon ships, to plead on behalf of the planet. Nobody ever\nheard what they said, they only heard the reply. The PA slammed\nback into life again. The voice was annoyed. It said:\n\n\"What do you mean you've never been to Alpha Centauri? For\nheaven's sake mankind, it's only four light years away you know.\nI'm sorry, but if you can't be bothered to take an interest in\nlocal affairs that's your own lookout.\n\n\"Energize the demolition beams\"\n\nLight poured out into the hatchways.\n\n\"I don't know\" said the voice on the PA, \"apathetic bloody\nplanet, I've no sympathy at all\" It cut off.\n\nThere was a terrible ghastly silence.\n\nThere was a terrible ghastly noise.\n\nThere was a terrible ghastly silence.\n\nThe Vogon Constructor fleet coasted away into the inky starry\nvoid.\n\n\n\n\nFar away on the opposite spiral arm of the Galaxy, five hundred\nthousand light years from the star Sol, Zaphod Beeblebrox,\nPresident of the Imperial Galactic Government, sped across the\nseas of Damogran, his ion drive delta boat winking and flashing\nin the Damogran sun.\n\nDamogran the hot; Damogran the remote; Damogran the almost\ntotally unheard of.\n\nDamogran, secret home of the Heart of Gold.\n\nThe boat sped on across the water. It would be some time before\nit reached its destination because Damogran is such an\ninconveniently arranged planet. It consists of nothing but\nmiddling to large desert islands separated by very pretty but\nannoyingly wide stretches of ocean.\n\nThe boat sped on.\n\nBecause of this topological awkwardness Damogran has always\nremained a deserted planet. This is why the Imperial Galactic\nGovernment chose Damogran for the Heart of Gold project, because\nit was so deserted and the Heart of Gold was so secret.\n\nThe boat zipped and skipped across the sea, the sea that lay\nbetween the main islands of the only archipelago of any useful\nsize on the whole planet. Zaphod Beeblebrox was on his way from\nthe tiny spaceport on Easter Island (the name was an entirely\nmeaningless coincidence in Galacticspeke, easter means small\nflat and light brown) to the Heart of Gold island, which by\nanother meaningless coincidence was called France.\n\nOne of the side effects of work on the Heart of Gold was a whole\nstring of pretty meaningless coincidences.\n\nBut it was not in any way a coincidence that today, the day of\nculmination of the project, the great day of unveiling, the day\nthat the Heart of Gold was finally to be introduced to a\nmarvelling Galaxy, was also a great day of culmination for Zaphod\nBeeblebrox. It was for the sake of this day that he had first\ndecided to run for the Presidency, a decision which had sent\nwaves of astonishment throughout the Imperial Galaxy Zaphod\nBeeblebrox? President? Not the Zaphod Beeblebrox? Not the\nPresident? Many had seen it as a clinching proof that the whole\nof known creation had finally gone bananas.\n\nZaphod grinned and gave the boat an extra kick of speed.\n\nZaphod Beeblebrox, adventurer, ex hippy, good timer, (crook?\nquite possibly), manic self publicist, terribly bad at personal\nrelationships, often thought to be completely out to lunch.\n\nPresident?\n\nNo one had gone bananas, not in that way at least.\n\nOnly six people in the entire Galaxy understood the principle on\nwhich the Galaxy was governed, and they knew that once Zaphod\nBeeblebrox had announced his intention to run as President it was\nmore or less a fait accompli: he was the ideal Presidency\nfodder*.\n\nWhat they completely failed to understand was why Zaphod was\ndoing it.\n\nHe banked sharply, shooting a wild wall of water at the sun.\n\nToday was the day; today was the day when they would realize what\nZaphod had been up to. Today was what Zaphod Beeblebrox's\nPresidency was all about. Today was also his two hundredth\nbirthday, but that was just another meaningless coincidence.\n\nAs he skipped his boat across the seas of Damogran he smiled\nquietly to himself about what a wonderful exciting day it was\ngoing to be. He relaxed and spread his two arms lazily across the\nseat back. He steered with an extra arm he'd recently fitted just\nbeneath his right one to help improve his ski boxing.\n\n\"Hey\" he cooed to himself, \"you're a real cool boy you\" But his\nnerves sang a song shriller than a dog whistle.\n\nThe island of France was about twenty miles long, five miles\nacross the middle, sandy and crescent shaped. In fact it seemed\nto exist not so much as an island in its own right as simply a\nmeans of defining the sweep and curve of a huge bay. This\nimpression was heightened by the fact that the inner coastline of\nthe crescent consisted almost entirely of steep cliffs. From the\ntop of the cliff the land sloped slowly down five miles to the\nopposite shore.\n\nOn top of the cliffs stood a reception committee.\n\nIt consisted in large part of the engineers and researchers who\nhad built the Heart of Gold mostly humanoid, but here and there\nwere a few reptiloid atomineers, two or three green slyph like\nmaximegalacticans, an octopoid physucturalist or two and a\nHooloovoo (a Hooloovoo is a super intelligent shade of the color\nblue). All except the Hooloovoo were resplendent in their multi \ncolored ceremonial lab coats; the Hooloovoo had been temporarily\nrefracted into a free standing prism for the occasion.\n\nThere was a mood of immense excitement thrilling through all of\nthem. Together and between them they had gone to and beyond the\nfurthest limits of physical laws, restructured the fundamental\nfabric of matter, strained, twisted and broken the laws of\npossibility and impossibility, but still the greatest excitement\nof all seemed to be to meet a man with an orange sash round his\nneck. (An orange sash was what the President of the Galaxy\ntraditionally wore.) It might not even have made much difference\nto them if they'd known exactly how much power the President of\nthe Galaxy actually wielded: none at all. Only six people in the\nGalaxy knew that the job of the Galactic President was not to\nwield power but to attract attention away from it.\n\nZaphod Beeblebrox was amazingly good at his job.\n\nThe crowd gasped, dazzled by sun and seemanship, as the\nPresidential speedboat zipped round the headland into the bay. It\nflashed and shone as it came skating over the sea in wide\nskidding turns.\n\nIn fact it didn't need to touch the water at all, because it was\nsupported on a hazy cushion of ionized atoms but just for\neffect it was fitted with thin finblades which could be lowered\ninto the water. They slashed sheets of water hissing into the\nair, carved deep gashes into the sea which swayed crazily and\nsank back foaming into the boat's wake as it careered across the\nbay.\n\nZaphod loved effect: it was what he was best at.\n\nHe twisted the wheel sharply, the boat slewed round in a wild\nscything skid beneath the cliff face and dropped to rest lightly\non the rocking waves.\n\nWithin seconds he ran out onto the deck and waved and grinned at\nover three billion people. The three billion people weren't\nactually there, but they watched his every gesture through the\neyes of a small robot tri D camera which hovered obsequiously in\nthe air nearby. The antics of the President always made amazingly\npopular tri D; that's what they were for.\n\nHe grinned again. Three billion and six people didn't know it,\nbut today would be a bigger antic than anyone had bargained for.\n\nThe robot camera homed in for a close up on the more popular of\nhis two heads and he waved again. He was roughly humanoid in\nappearance except for the extra head and third arm. His fair\ntousled hair stuck out in random directions, his blue eyes\nglinted with something completely unidentifiable, and his chins\nwere almost always unshaven.\n\nA twenty foot high transparent globe floated next to his boat,\nrolling and bobbing, glistening in the brilliant sun. Inside it\nfloated a wide semi circular sofa upholstered in glorious red\nleather: the more the globe bobbed and rolled, the more the sofa\nstayed perfectly still, steady as an upholstered rock. Again, all\ndone for effect as much as anything.\n\nZaphod stepped through the wall of the globe and relaxed on the\nsofa. He spread his two arms lazily along the back and with the\nthird brushed some dust off his knee. His heads looked about,\nsmiling; he put his feet up. At any moment, he thought, he might\nscream.\n\nWater boiled up beneath the bubble, it seethed and spouted. The\nbubble surged into the air, bobbing and rolling on the water\nspout. Up, up it climbed, throwing stilts of light at the cliff.\nUp it surged on the jet, the water falling from beneath it,\ncrashing back into the sea hundreds of feet below.\n\nZaphod smiled, picturing himself.\n\nA thoroughly ridiculous form of transport, but a thoroughly\nbeautiful one.\n\nAt the top of the cliff the globe wavered for a moment, tipped on\nto a railed ramp, rolled down it to a small concave platform and\nriddled to a halt.\n\nTo tremendous applause Zaphod Beeblebrox stepped out of the\nbubble, his orange sash blazing in the light.\n\nThe President of the Galaxy had arrived.\n\nHe waited for the applause to die down, then raised his hands in\ngreeting.\n\n\"Hi\" he said.\n\nA government spider sidled up to him and attempted to press a\ncopy of his prepared speech into his hands. Pages three to seven\nof the original version were at the moment floating soggily on\nthe Damogran sea some five miles out from the bay. Pages one and\ntwo had been salvaged by a Damogran Frond Crested Eagle and had\nalready become incorporated into an extraordinary new form of\nnest which the eagle had invented. It was constructed largely of\npapier m@ch@ and it was virtually impossible for a newly hatched\nbaby eagle to break out of it. The Damogran Frond Crested Eagle\nhad heard of the notion of survival of the species but wanted no\ntruck with it.\n\nZaphod Beeblebrox would not be needing his set speech and he\ngently deflected the one being offered him by the spider.\n\n\"Hi\" he said again.\n\nEveryone beamed at him, or, at least, nearly everyone. He singled\nout Trillian from the crowd. Trillian was a gird that Zaphod had\npicked up recently whilst visiting a planet, just for fun,\nincognito. She was slim, darkish, humanoid, with long waves of\nblack hair, a full mouth, an odd little nob of a nose and\nridiculously brown eyes. With her red head scarf knotted in that\nparticular way and her long flowing silky brown dress she looked\nvaguely Arabic. Not that anyone there had ever heard of an Arab\nof course. The Arabs had very recently ceased to exist, and even\nwhen they had existed they were five hundred thousand light years\nfrom Damogran. Trillian wasn't anybody in particular, or so\nZaphod claimed. She just went around with him rather a lot and\ntold him what she thought of him.\n\n\"Hi honey\" he said to her.\n\nShe flashed him a quick tight smile and looked away. Then she\nlooked back for a moment and smiled more warmly but by this\ntime he was looking at something else.\n\n\"Hi\" he said to a small knot of creatures from the press who\nwere standing nearby wishing that he would stop saying Hi and get\non with the quotes. He grinned at them particularly because he\nknew that in a few moments he would be giving them one hell of a\nquote.\n\nThe next thing he said though was not a lot of use to them. One\nof the officials of the party had irritably decided that the\nPresident was clearly not in a mood to read the deliciously\nturned speech that had been written for him, and had flipped the\nswitch on the remote control device in his pocket. Away in front\nof them a huge white dome that bulged against the sky cracked\ndown in the middle, split, and slowly folded itself down into the\nground. Everyone gasped although they had known perfectly well it\nwas going to do that because they had built it that way.\n\nBeneath it lay uncovered a huge starship, one hundred and fifty\nmetres long, shaped like a sleek running shoe, perfectly white\nand mindboggingly beautiful. At the heart of it, unseen, lay a\nsmall gold box which carried within it the most brain wretching\ndevice ever conceived, a device which made this starship unique\nin the history of the galaxy, a device after which the ship had\nbeen named The Heart of Gold.\n\"Wow\", said Zaphod Beeblebrox to the Heart of Gold. There wasn't\nmuch else he could say.\n\nHe said it again because he knew it would annoy the press.\n\n\"Wow\"\n\nThe crowd turned their faces back towards him expectantly. He\nwinked at Trillian who raised her eyebrows and widened her eyes\nat him. She knew what he was about to say and thought him a\nterrible showoff.\n\n\"That is really amazing\" he said. \"That really is truly amazing.\nThat is so amazingly amazing I think I'd like to steal it\"\n\nA marvellous Presidential quote, absolutely true to form. The\ncrowd laughed appreciatively, the newsmen gleefully punched\nbuttons on their Sub Etha News Matics and the President grinned.\n\nAs he grinned his heart screamed unbearably and he fingered the\nsmall Paralyso Matic bomb that nestled quietly in his pocket.\n\nFinally he could bear it no more. He lifted his heads up to the\nsky, let out a wild whoop in major thirds, threw the bomb to the\nground and ran forward through the sea of suddenly frozen smiles.\n\n\n\n\nProstetnic Vogon Jeltz was not a pleasant sight, even for other\nVogons. His highly domed nose rose high above a small piggy\nforehead. His dark green rubbery skin was thick enough for him to\nplay the game of Vogon Civil Service politics, and play it well,\nand waterproof enough for him to survive indefinitely at sea\ndepths of up to a thousand feet with no ill effects.\n\nNot that he ever went swimming of course. His busy schedule would\nnot allow it. He was the way he was because billions of years ago\nwhen the Vogons had first crawled out of the sluggish primeval\nseas of Vogsphere, and had lain panting and heaving on the\nplanet's virgin shores... when the first rays of the bright young\nVogsol sun had shone across them that morning, it was as if the\nforces of evolution ad simply given up on them there and then,\nhad turned aside in disgust and written them off as an ugly and\nunfortunate mistake. They never evolved again; they should never\nhave survived.\n\nThe fact that they did is some kind of tribute to the thick \nwilled slug brained stubbornness of these creatures. Evolution?\nthey said to themselves, Who needs it?, and what nature refused\nto do for them they simply did without until such time as they\nwere able to rectify the grosser anatomical inconveniences with\nsurgery.\n\nMeanwhile, the natural forces on the planet Vogsphere had been\nworking overtime to make up for their earlier blunder. They\nbrought forth scintillating jewelled scuttling crabs, which the\nVogons ate, smashing their shells with iron mallets; tall\naspiring trees with breathtaking slenderness and colour which the\nVogons cut down and burned the crab meat with; elegant gazelle \nlike creatures with silken coats and dewy eyes which the Vogons\nwould catch and sit on. They were no use as transport because\ntheir backs would snap instantly, but the Vogons sat on them\nanyway.\n\nThus the planet Vogsphere whiled away the unhappy millennia until\nthe Vogons suddenly discovered the principles of interstellar\ntravel. Within a few short Vog years every last Vogon had\nmigrated to the Megabrantis cluster, the political hub of the\nGalaxy and now formed the immensely powerful backbone of the\nGalactic Civil Service. They have attempted to acquire learning,\nthey have attempted to acquire style and social grace, but in\nmost respects the modern Vogon is little different from his\nprimitive forebears. Every year they import twenty seven thousand\nscintillating jewelled scuttling crabs from their native planet\nand while away a happy drunken night smashing them to bits with\niron mallets.\n\nProstetnic Vogon Jeltz was a fairly typical Vogon in that he was\nthoroughly vile. Also, he did not like hitch hikers.\n\nSomewhere in a small dark cabin buried deep in the intestines of\nProstetnic Vogon Jeltz's flagship, a small match flared\nnervously. The owner of the match was not a Vogon, but he knew\nall about them and was right to be nervous. His name was Ford\nPrefect*.\n\nHe looked about the cabin but could see very little; strange\nmonstrous shadows loomed and leaped with the tiny flickering\nflame, but all was quiet. He breathed a silent thank you to the\nDentrassis. The Dentrassis are an unruly tribe of gourmands, a\nwild but pleasant bunch whom the Vogons had recently taken to\nemploying as catering staff on their long haul fleets, on the\nstrict understanding that they keep themselves very much to\nthemselves.\n\nThis suited the Dentrassis fine, because they loved Vogon money,\nwhich is one of the hardest currencies in space, but loathed the\nVogons themselves. The only sort of Vogon a Dentrassi liked to\nsee was an annoyed Vogon.\n\nIt was because of this tiny piece of information that Ford\nPrefect was not now a whiff of hydrogen, ozone and carbon\nmonoxide.\n\nHe heard a slight groan. By the light of the match he saw a heavy\nshape moving slightly on the floor. Quickly he shook the match\nout, reached in his pocket, found what he was looking for and\ntook it out. He crouched on the floor. The shape moved again.\n\nFord Prefect said: \"I bought some peanuts\"\n\nArthur Dent moved, and groaned again, muttering incoherently.\n\n\"Here, have some\" urged Ford, shaking the packet again, \"if\nyou've never been through a matter transference beam before\nyou've probably lost some salt and protein. The beer you had\nshould have cushioned your system a bit\"\n\"Whhhrrrr..\" said Arthur Dent. He opened his eyes.\n\n\"It's dark\" he said.\n\n\"Yes\" said Ford Prefect, \"it's dark\"\n\n\"No light\" said Arthur Dent. \"Dark, no light\"\n\nOne of the things Ford Prefect had always found hardest to\nunderstand about human beings was their habit of continually\nstating and repeating the obvious, as in It's a nice day, or\nYou're very tall, or Oh dear you seem to have fallen down a\nthirty foot well, are you alright? At first Ford had formed a\ntheory to account for this strange behaviour. If human beings\ndon't keep exercising their lips, he thought, their mouths\nprobably seize up. After a few months' consideration and\nobservation he abandoned this theory in favour of a new one. If\nthey don't keep on exercising their lips, he thought, their\nbrains start working. After a while he abandoned this one as well\nas being obstructively cynical and decided he quite liked human\nbeings after all, but he always remained desperately worried\nabout the terrible number of things they didn't know about.\n\n\"Yes\" he agreed with Arthur, \"no light\" He helped Arthur to\nsome peanuts. \"How do you feel?\" he asked.\n\n\"Like a military academy\" said Arthur, \"bits of me keep on\npassing out\"\n\nFord stared at him blankly in the darkness.\n\n\"If I asked you where the hell we were\" said Arthur weakly,\n\"would I regret it?\"\n\nFord stood up. \"We're safe\" he said.\n\n\"Oh good\" said Arthur.\n\n\"We're in a small galley cabin\" said Ford, \"in one of the\nspaceships of the Vogon Constructor Fleet\"\n\n\"Ah\" said Arthur, \"this is obviously some strange usage of the\nword safe that I wasn't previously aware of\"\n\nFord struck another match to help him search for a light switch.\nMonstrous shadows leaped and loomed again. Arthur struggled to\nhis feet and hugged himself apprehensively. Hideous alien shapes\nseemed to throng about him, the air was thick with musty smells\nwhich sidled into his lungs without identifying themselves, and a\nlow irritating hum kept his brain from focusing.\n\n\"How did we get here?\" he asked, shivering slightly.\n\n\"We hitched a lift\" said Ford.\n\n\"Excuse me?\" said Arthur. \"Are you trying to tell me that we just\nstuck out our thumbs and some green bug eyed monster stuck his\nhead out and said, Hi fellas, hop right in. I can take you as far\nas the Basingstoke roundabout?\"\n\n\"Well\" said Ford, \"the Thumb's an electronic sub etha signalling\ndevice, the roundabout's at Barnard's Star six light years away,\nbut otherwise, that's more or less right\"\n\n\"And the bug eyed monster?\"\n\n\"Is green, yes\"\n\n\"Fine\" said Arthur, \"when can I get home?\"\n\n\"You can't\" said Ford Prefect, and found the light switch.\n\n\"Shade your eyes ..\" he said, and turned it on.\n\nEven Ford was surprised.\n\n\"Good grief\" said Arthur, \"is this really the interior of a\nflying saucer?\"\n\nProstetnic Vogon Jeltz heaved his unpleasant green body round the\ncontrol bridge. He always felt vaguely irritable after\ndemolishing populated planets. He wished that someone would come\nand tell him that it was all wrong so that he could shout at them\nand feel better. He flopped as heavily as he could on to his\ncontrol seat in the hope that it would break and give him\nsomething to be genuinely angry about, but it only gave a\ncomplaining sort of creak.\n\n\"Go away!\" he shouted at a young Vogon guard who entered the\nbridge at that moment. The guard vanished immediately, feeling\nrather relieved. He was glad it wouldn't now be him who delivered\nthe report they'd just received. The report was an official\nrelease which said that a wonderful new form of spaceship drive\nwas at this moment being unveiled at a government research base\non Damogran which would henceforth make all hyperspatial express\nroutes unnecessary.\n\nAnother door slid open, but this time the Vogon captain didn't\nshout because it was the door from the galley quarters where the\nDentrassis prepared his meals. A meal would be most welcome.\n\nA huge furry creature bounded through the door with his lunch\ntray. It was grinning like a maniac.\n\nProstetnic Vogon Jeltz was delighted. He knew that when a\nDentrassi looked that pleased with itself there was something\ngoing on somewhere on the ship that he could get very angry\nindeed about.\n\nFord and Arthur stared about them.\n\n\"Well, what do you think?\" said Ford.\n\n\"It's a bit squalid, isn't it?\"\n\nFord frowned at the grubby mattress, unwashed cups and\nunidentifiable bits of smelly alien underwear that lay around the\ncramped cabin.\n\n\"Well, this is a working ship, you see\" said Ford. \"These are\nthe Dentrassi sleeping quarters\"\n\n\"I thought you said they were called Vogons or something\"\n\n\"Yes\" said Ford, \"the Vogons run the ship, the Dentrassis are\nthe cooks, they let us on board\"\n\n\"I'm confused\" said Arthur.\n\n\"Here, have a look at this\" said Ford. He sat down on one of the\nmattresses and rummaged about in his satchel. Arthur prodded the\nmattress nervously and then sat on it himself: in fact he had\nvery little to be nervous about, because all mattresses grown in\nthe swamps of Squornshellous Zeta are very thoroughly killed and\ndried before being put to service. Very few have ever come to\nlife again.\n\nFord handed the book to Arthur.\n\n\"What is it?\" asked Arthur.\n\n\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. It's a sort of electronic\nbook. It tells you everything you need to know about anything.\nThat's its job\"\n\nArthur turned it over nervously in his hands.\n\n\"I like the cover\" he said. \"Don't Panic. It's the first helpful\nor intelligible thing anybody's said to me all day\"\n\n\"I'll show you how it works\" said Ford. He snatched it from\nArthur who was still holding it as if it was a two week dead lark\nand pulled it out of its cover.\n\n\"You press this button here you see and the screen lights up\ngiving you the index\"\n\nA screen, about three inches by four, lit up and characters began\nto flicker across the surface.\n\n\"You want to know about Vogons, so I enter that name so\" His\nfingers tapped some more keys. \"And there we are\"\n\nThe words Vogon Constructor Fleets flared in green across the\nscreen.\n\nFord pressed a large red button at the bottom of the screen and\nwords began to undulate across it. At the same time, the book\nbegan to speak the entry as well in a still quiet measured voice.\nThis is what the book said.\n\n\"Vogon Constructor Fleets. Here is what to do if you want to get\na lift from a Vogon: forget it. They are one of the most\nunpleasant races in the Galaxy not actually evil, but bad\ntempered, bureaucratic, officious and callous. They wouldn't even\nlift a finger to save their own grandmothers from the Ravenous\nBugblatter Beast of Traal without orders signed in triplicate,\nsent in, sent back, queried, lost, found, subjected to public\ninquiry, lost again, and finally buried in soft peat and recycled\nas firelighters.\n\n\"The best way to get a drink out of a Vogon is to stick your\nfinger down his throat, and the best way to irritate him is to\nfeed his grandmother to the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal.\n\n\"On no account allow a Vogon to read poetry at you\"\n\nArthur blinked at it.\n\n\"What a strange book. How did we get a lift then?\"\n\n\"That's the point, it's out of date now\" said Ford, sliding the\nbook back into its cover. \"I'm doing the field research for the\nNew Revised Edition, and one of the things I'll have to include\nis a bit about how the Vogons now employ Dentrassi cooks which\ngives us a rather useful little loophole\"\n\nA pained expression crossed Arthur's face. \"But who are the\nDentrassi?\" he said.\n\n\"Great guys\" said Ford. \"They're the best cooks and the best\ndrink mixers and they don't give a wet slap about anything else.\nAnd they'll always help hitch hikers aboard, partly because they\nlike the company, but mostly because it annoys the Vogons. Which\nis exactly the sort of thing you need to know if you're an\nimpoverished hitch hiker trying to see the marvels of the\nUniverse for less than thirty Altairan Dollars a day. And that's\nmy job. Fun, isn't it?\"\n\nArthur looked lost.\n\n\"It's amazing\" he said and frowned at one of the other\nmattresses.\n\n\"Unfortunately I got stuck on the Earth for rather longer than I\nintended\" said Ford. \"I came for a week and got stuck for\nfifteen years\"\n\n\"But how did you get there in the first place then?\"\n\n\"Easy, I got a lift with a teaser\"\n\n\"A teaser?\"\n\n\"Yeah\"\n\n\"Er, what is ..\"\n\n\"A teaser? Teasers are usually rich kids with nothing to do. They\ncruise around looking for planets which haven't made interstellar\ncontact yet and buzz them\"\n\n\"Buzz them?\" Arthur began to feel that Ford was enjoying making\nlife difficult for him.\n\"Yeah\", said Ford, \"they buzz them. They find some isolated spot\nwith very few people around, then land right by some poor soul\nwhom no one's ever going to believe and then strut up and down in\nfront of him wearing silly antennae on their heads and making\nbeep beep noises. Rather childish really\" Ford leant back on the\nmattress with his hands behind his head and looked infuriatingly\npleased with himself.\n\n\"Ford\" insisted Arthur, \"I don't know if this sounds like a\nsilly question, but what am I doing here?\"\n\n\"Well you know that\" said Ford. \"I rescued you from the Earth\"\n\n\"And what's happened to the Earth?\"\n\n\"Ah. It's been demolished\"\n\n\"Has it\" said Arthur levelly.\n\n\"Yes. It just boiled away into space\"\n\n\"Look\" said Arthur, \"I'm a bit upset about that\"\n\nFord frowned to himself and seemed to roll the thought around his\nmind.\n\n\"Yes, I can understand that\" he said at last.\n\n\"Understand that!\" shouted Arthur. \"Understand that!\"\n\nFord sprang up.\n\n\"Keep looking at the book!\" he hissed urgently.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Don't Panic\"\n\n\"I'm not panicking!\"\n\n\"Yes you are\"\n\n\"Alright so I'm panicking, what else is there to do?\"\n\n\"You just come along with me and have a good time. The Galaxy's a\nfun place. You'll need to have this fish in your ear\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon?\" asked Arthur, rather politely he thought.\n\nFord was holding up a small glass jar which quite clearly had a\nsmall yellow fish wriggling around in it. Arthur blinked at him.\nHe wished there was something simple and recognizable he could\ngrasp hold of. He would have felt safe if alongside the Dentrassi\nunderwear, the piles of Squornshellous mattresses and the man\nfrom Betelgeuse holding up a small yellow fish and offering to\nput it in his ear he had been able to see just a small packet of\ncorn flakes. He couldn't, and he didn't feel safe.\n\nSuddenly a violent noise leapt at them from no source that he\ncould identify. He gasped in terror at what sounded like a man\ntrying to gargle whilst fighting off a pack of wolves.\n\n\"Shush!\" said Ford. \"Listen, it might be important\"\n\n\"Im ... important?\"\n\n\"It's the Vogon captain making an announcement on the T'annoy\"\n\n\"You mean that's how the Vogons talk?\"\n\n\"Listen!\"\n\n\"But I can't speak Vogon!\"\n\n\"You don't need to. Just put that fish in your ear\"\n\nFord, with a lightning movement, clapped his hand to Arthur's\near, and he had the sudden sickening sensation of the fish\nslithering deep into his aural tract. Gasping with horror he\nscrabbled at his ear for a second or so, but then slowly turned\ngoggle eyed with wonder. He was experiencing the aural equivalent\nof looking at a picture of two black silhouetted faces and\nsuddenly seeing it as a picture of a white candlestick. Or of\nlooking at a lot of coloured dots on a piece of paper which\nsuddenly resolve themselves into the figure six and mean that\nyour optician is going to charge you a lot of money for a new\npair of glasses.\n\nHe was still listening to the howling gargles, he knew that, only\nnow it had taken on the semblance of perfectly straightforward\nEnglish.\n\nThis is what he heard ...\n\n\n\n\n\"Howl howl gargle howl gargle howl howl howl gargle howl gargle\nhowl howl gargle gargle howl gargle gargle gargle howl slurrp\nuuuurgh should have a good time. Message repeats. This is your\ncaptain speaking, so stop whatever you're doing and pay\nattention. First of all I see from our instruments that we have a\ncouple of hitchhikers aboard. Hello wherever you are. I just want\nto make it totally clear that you are not at all welcome. I\nworked hard to get where I am today, and I didn't become captain\nof a Vogon constructor ship simply so I could turn it into a taxi\nservice for a load of degenerate freeloaders. I have sent out a\nsearch party, and as soon that they find you I will put you off\nthe ship. If you're very lucky I might read you some of my poetry\nfirst.\n\n\"Secondly, we are about to jump into hyperspace for the journey\nto Barnard's Star. On arrival we will stay in dock for a\nseventy two hour refit, and no one's to leave the ship during\nthat time. I repeat, all planet leave is cancelled. I've just had\nan unhappy love affair, so I don't see why anybody else should\nhave a good time. Message ends\"\nThe noise stopped.\n\nArthur discovered to his embarrassment that he was lying curled\nup in a small ball on the floor with his arms wrapped round his\nhead. He smiled weakly.\n\n\"Charming man\" he said. \"I wish I had a daughter so I could\nforbid her to marry one ..\"\n\n\"You wouldn't need to\" said Ford. \"They've got as much sex\nappeal as a road accident. No, don't move\" he added as Arthur\nbegan to uncurl himself, \"you'd better be prepared for the jump\ninto hyperspace. It's unpleasantly like being drunk\"\n\n\"What's so unpleasant about being drunk?\"\n\n\"You ask a glass of water\"\n\nArthur thought about this.\n\n\"Ford\" he said.\n\n\"Yeah?\"\n\n\"What's this fish doing in my ear?\"\n\n\"It's translating for you. It's a Babel fish. Look it up in the\nbook if you like\"\n\nHe tossed over The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy and then\ncurled himself up into a foetal ball to prepare himself for the\njump.\n\nAt that moment the bottom fell out of Arthur's mind.\n\nHis eyes turned inside out. His feet began to leak out of the top\nof his head.\n\nThe room folded flat about him, spun around, shifted out of\nexistence and left him sliding into his own navel.\n\nThey were passing through hyperspace.\n\n\"The Babel fish\" said The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy\nquietly, \"is small, yellow and leech like, and probably the\noddest thing in the Universe. It feeds on brainwave energy not\nfrom its carrier but from those around it. It absorbs all\nunconscious mental frequencies from this brainwave energy to\nnourish itself with. It then excretes into the mind of its\ncarrier a telepathic matrix formed by combining the conscious\nthought frequencies with nerve signals picked up from the speech\ncentres of the brain which has supplied them. The practical\nupshot of all this is that if you stick a Babel fish in your ear\nyou can instantly understand anything said to you in any form of\nlanguage. The speech patterns you actually hear decode the\nbrainwave matrix which has been fed into your mind by your Babel\nfish.\n\n\"Now it is such a bizarrely improbable coincidence that anything\nso mind\\ bog\\ gin\\ gly useful could have evolved purely by chance that\nsome thin\\ kers have chosen to see it as the final and clinching\nproof of the non existence of God.\n\n\"The argument goes something like this: `I refuse to prove that I\nexist,' says God, `for proof denies faith, and without faith I am\nnothing.'\n\n\"`But,' says Man, `The Babel fish is a dead giveaway, isn't it?\nIt could not have evolved by chance. It proves you exist, and so\ntherefore, by your own arguments, you don't. QED.'\n\n\"`Oh dear,' says God, `I hadn't thought of that,' and promptly\nvanished in a puff of logic.\n\n\"`Oh, that was easy,' says Man, and for an encore goes on to\nprove that black is white and gets himself killed on the next\nzebra crossing.\n\n\"Most leading theologians claim that this argument is a load of\ndingo's kidneys, but that didn't stop Oolon Colluphid making a\nsmall fortune when he used it as the central theme of his best \nselling book Well That About Wraps It Up For God.\n\n\"Meanwhile, the poor Babel fish, by effectively removing all\nbarriers to communication between different races and cultures,\nhas caused more and bloddier wars than anything else in the\nhistory of creation\"\n\nArthur let out a low groan. He was horrified to discover that the\nkick through hyperspace hadn't killed him. He was now six light\nyears from the place that the Earth would have been if it still\nexisted.\n\nThe Earth.\n\nVisions of it swam sickeningly through his nauseated mind. There\nwas no way his imagination could feel the impact of the whole\nEarth having gone, it was too big. He prodded his feelings by\nthinking that his parents and his sister had gone. No reaction.\nHe thought of all the people he had been close to. No reaction.\nThen he thought of a complete stranger he had been standing\nbehind in the queue at the supermarket before and felt a sudden\nstab the supermarket was gone, everything in it was gone.\nNelson's Column had gone! Nelson's Column had gone and there\nwould be no outcry, because there was no one left to make an\noutcry. From now on Nelson's Column only existed in his mind.\nEngland only existed in his mind his mind, stuck here in this\ndank smelly steel lined spaceship. A wave of claustrophobia\nclosed in on him.\n\nEngland no longer existed. He'd got that somehow he'd got it.\nHe tried again. America, he thought, has gone. He couldn't grasp\nit. He decided to start smaller again. New York has gone. No\nreaction. He'd never seriously believed it existed anyway. The\ndollar, he thought, had sunk for ever. Slight tremor there. Every\nBogart movie has been wiped, he said to himself, and that gave\nhim a nasty knock. McDonalds, he thought. There is no longer any\nsuch thing as a McDonald's hamburger.\nHe passed out. When he came round a second later he found he was\nsobbing for his mother.\n\nHe jerked himself violently to his feet.\n\n\"Ford!\"\n\nFord looked up from where he was sitting in a corner humming to\nhimself. He always found the actual travelling through space part\nof space travel rather trying.\n\n\"Yeah?\" he said.\n\n\"If you're a researcher on this book thing and you were on Earth,\nyou must have been gathering material on it\"\n\n\"Well, I was able to extend the original entry a bit, yes\"\n\n\"Let me see what it says in this edition then, I've got to see\nit\"\n\n\"Yeah OK\" He passed it over again.\n\nArthur grabbed hold of it and tried to stop his hands shaking. He\npressed the entry for the relevant page. The screen flashed and\nswirled and resolved into a page of print. Arthur stared at it.\n\n\"It doesn't have an entry!\" he burst out.\n\nFord looked over his shoulder.\n\n\"Yes it does\" he said, \"down there, see at the bottom of the\nscreen, just under Eccentrica Gallumbits, the triple breasted\nwhore of Eroticon 6\"\n\nArthur followed Ford's finger, and saw where it was pointing. For\na moment it still didn't register, then his mind nearly blew up.\n\n\"What? Harmless? Is that all it's got to say? Harmless! One\nword!\"\n\nFord shrugged.\n\n\"Well, there are a hundred billion stars in the Galaxy, and only\na limited amount of space in the book's microprocessors\" he\nsaid, \"and no one knew much about the Earth of course\"\n\n\"Well for God's sake I hope you managed to rectify that a bit\"\n\n\"Oh yes, well I managed to transmit a new entry off to the\neditor. He had to trim it a bit, but it's still an improvement\"\n\n\"And what does it say now?\" asked Arthur.\n\n\"Mostly harmless\" admitted Ford with a slightly embarrassed\ncough.\n\n\"Mostly harmless!\" shouted Arthur.\n\"What was that noise?\" hissed Ford.\n\n\"It was me shouting\" shouted Arthur.\n\n\"No! Shut up!\" said Ford. I think we're in trouble\"\n\n\"You think we're in trouble!\"\n\nOutside the door were the sounds of marching feet.\n\n\"The Dentrassi?\" whispered Arthur.\n\n\"No, those are steel tipped boots\" said Ford.\n\nThere was a sharp ringing rap on the door.\n\n\"Then who is it?\" said Arthur.\n\n\"Well\" said Ford, \"if we're lucky it's just the Vogons come to\nthrow us in to space\"\n\n\"And if we're unlucky?\"\n\n\"If we're unlucky\" said Ford grimly, \"the captain might be\nserious in his threat that he's going to read us some of his\npoetry first ..\"\n\n\n\n\nVogon poetry is of course the third worst in the Universe.\n\nThe second worst is that of the Azagoths of Kria. During a\nrecitation by their Poet Master Grunthos the Flatulent of his\npoem \"Ode To A Small Lump of Green Putty I Found In My Armpit One\nMidsummer Morning\" four of his audience died of internal\nhaemorrhaging, and the President of the Mid Galactic Arts\nNobbling Council survived by gnawing one of his own legs off.\nGrunthos is reported to have been \"disappointed\" by the poem's\nreception, and was about to embark on a reading of his twelve \nbook epic entitled My Favourite Bathtime Gurgles when his own\nmajor intestine, in a desperate attempt to save life and\ncivilization, leapt straight up through his neck and throttled\nhis brain.\n\nThe very worst poetry of all perished along with its creator\nPaula Nancy Millstone Jennings of Greenbridge, Essex, England in\nthe destruction of the planet Earth.\n\nProstetnic Vogon Jeltz smiled very slowly. This was done not so\nmuch for effect as because he was trying to remember the sequence\nof muscle movements. He had had a terribly therapeutic yell at\nhis prisoners and was now feeling quite relaxed and ready for a\nlittle callousness.\n\nThe prisoners sat in Poetry Appreciation Chairs strapped in.\nVogons suffered no illusions as to the regard their works were\ngenerally held in. Their early attempts at composition had been\npart of bludgeoning insistence that they be accepted as a\nproperly evolved and cultured race, but now the only thing that\nkept them going was sheer bloodymindedness.\n\nThe sweat stood out cold on Ford Prefect's brow, and slid round\nthe electrodes strapped to his temples. These were attached to a\nbattery of electronic equipment imagery intensifiers, rhythmic\nmodulators, alliterative residulators and simile dumpers all\ndesigned to heighten the experience of the poem and make sure\nthat not a single nuance of the poet's thought was lost.\n\nArthur Dent sat and quivered. He had no idea what he was in for,\nbut he knew that he hadn't liked anything that had happened so\nfar and didn't think things were likely to change.\n\nThe Vogon began to read a fetid little passage of his own\ndevising.\n\n\"Oh frettled gruntbuggly ..\" he began. Spasms wracked Ford's\nbody this was worse than ever he'd been prepared for.\n\n\"... thy micturations are to me | As plurdled gabbleblotchits on\na lurgid bee\"\n\n\"Aaaaaaarggggghhhhhh!\" went Ford Prefect, wrenching his head back\nas lumps of pain thumped through it. He could dimly see beside\nhim Arthur lolling and rolling in his seat. He clenched his\nteeth.\n\n\"Groop I implore thee\" continued the merciless Vogon, \"my\nfoonting turlingdromes\"\n\nHis voice was rising to a horrible pitch of impassioned\nstridency. \"And hooptiously drangle me with crinkly\nbindlewurdles,| Or I will rend thee in the gobberwarts with my\nblurglecruncheon, see if I don't!\"\n\n\"Nnnnnnnnnnyyyyyyyuuuuuuurrrrrrrggggggghhhhh!\" cried Ford Prefect\nand threw one final spasm as the electronic enhancement of the\nlast line caught him full blast across the temples. He went limp.\n\nArthur lolled.\n\n\"Now Earthlings ..\" whirred the Vogon (he didn't know that Ford\nPrefect was in fact from a small planet in the vicinity of\nBetelgeuse, and wouldn't have cared if he had) \"I present you\nwith a simple choice! Either die in the vacuum of space, or ..\"\nhe paused for melodramatic effect, \"tell me how good you thought\nmy poem was!\"\n\nHe threw himself backwards into a huge leathery bat shaped seat\nand watched them. He did the smile again.\n\nFord was rasping for breath. He rolled his dusty tongue round his\nparched mouth and moaned.\n\nArthur said brightly: \"Actually I quite liked it\"\n\nFord turned and gaped. Here was an approach that had quite simply\nnot occurred to him.\n\nThe Vogon raised a surprised eyebrow that effectively obscured\nhis nose and was therefore no bad thing.\n\n\"Oh good ..\" he whirred, in considerable astonishment.\n\n\"Oh yes\" said Arthur, \"I thought that some of the metaphysical\nimagery was really particularly effective\"\n\nFord continued to stare at him, slowly organizing his thoughts\naround this totally new concept. Were they really going to be\nable to bareface their way out of this?\n\n\"Yes, do continue ..\" invited the Vogon.\n\n\"Oh ... and er ... interesting rhythmic devices too\" continued\nArthur, \"which seemed to counterpoint the ... er ... er ..\" He\nfloundered.\n\nFord leaped to his rescue, hazarding \"counterpoint the surrealism\nof the underlying metaphor of the ... er ..\" He floundered too,\nbut Arthur was ready again.\n\n\"... humanity of the ..\"\n\n\"Vogonity\" Ford hissed at him.\n\n\"Ah yes, Vogonity (sorry) of the poet's compassionate soul\"\nArthur felt he was on a home stretch now, \"which contrives\nthrough the medium of the verse structure to sublimate this,\ntranscend that, and come to terms with the fundamental\ndichotomies of the other\" (he was reaching a triumphant\ncrescendo ...) \"and one is left with a profound and vivid insight\ninto ... into ... er ..\" (... which suddenly gave out on him.)\nFord leaped in with the coup de gr@ce:\n\n\"Into whatever it was the poem was about!\" he yelled. Out of the\ncorner of his mouth: \"Well done, Arthur, that was very good\"\n\nThe Vogon perused them. For a moment his embittered racial soul\nhad been touched, but he thought no too little too late. His\nvoice took on the quality of a cat snagging brushed nylon.\n\n\"So what you're saying is that I write poetry because underneath\nmy mean callous heartless exterior I really just want to be\nloved\" he said. He paused. \"Is that right?\"\n\nFord laughed a nervous laugh. \"Well I mean yes\" he said, \"don't\nwe all, deep down, you know ... er ..\"\n\nThe Vogon stood up.\n\n\"No, well you're completely wrong\" he said, \"I just write poetry\nto throw my mean callous heartless exterior into sharp relief.\nI'm going to throw you off the ship anyway. Guard! Take the\nprisoners to number three airlock and throw them out!\"\n\n\"What?\" shouted Ford.\nA huge young Vogon guard stepped forward and yanked them out of\ntheir straps with his huge blubbery arms.\n\n\"You can't throw us into space\" yelled Ford, \"we're trying to\nwrite a book\"\n\n\"Resistance is useless!\" shouted the Vogon guard back at him. It\nwas the first phrase he'd learnt when he joined the Vogon Guard\nCorps.\n\nThe captain watched with detached amusement and then turned away.\n\nArthur stared round him wildly.\n\n\"I don't want to die now!\" he yelled. \"I've still got a headache!\nI don't want to go to heaven with a headache, I'd be all cross\nand wouldn't enjoy it!\"\n\nThe guard grasped them both firmly round the neck, and bowing\ndeferentially towards his captain's back, hoiked them both\nprotesting out of the bridge. A steel door closed and the captain\nwas on his own again. He hummed quietly and mused to himself,\nlightly fingering his notebook of verses.\n\n\"Hmmmm\" he said, \"counterpoint the surrealism of the underlying\nmetaphor ..\" He considered this for a moment, and then closed\nthe book with a grim smile.\n\n\"Death's too good for them\" he said.\n\nThe long steel lined corridor echoed to the feeble struggles of\nthe two humanoids clamped firmly under rubbery Vogon armpits.\n\n\"This is great\" spluttered Arthur, \"this is really terrific. Let\ngo of me you brute!\"\n\nThe Vogon guard dragged them on.\n\n\"Don't you worry\" said Ford, \"I'll think of something\" He\ndidn't sound hopeful.\n\n\"Resistance is useless!\" bellowed the guard.\n\n\"Just don't say things like that\" stammered Ford. \"How can\nanyone maintain a positive mental attitude if you're saying\nthings like that?\"\n\n\"My God\" complained Arthur, \"you're talking about a positive\nmental attitude and you haven't even had your planet demolished\ntoday. I woke up this morning and thought I'd have a nice relaxed\nday, do a bit of reading, brush the dog ... It's now just after\nfour in the afternoon and I'm already thrown out of an alien\nspaceship six light years from the smoking remains of the Earth!\"\nHe spluttered and gurgled as the Vogon tightened his grip.\n\n\"Alright\" said Ford, \"just stop panicking\"\n\n\"Who said anything about panicking?\" snapped Arthur. \"This is\nstill just the culture shock. You wait till I've settled down\ninto the situation and found my bearings. Then I'll start\npanicking\"\n\n\"Arthur you're getting hysterical. Shut up!\" Ford tried\ndesperately to think, but was interrupted by the guard shouting\nagain.\n\n\"Resistance is useless!\"\n\n\"And you can shut up as well!\" snapped Ford.\n\n\"Resistance is useless!\"\n\n\"Oh give it a rest\" said Ford. He twisted his head till he was\nlooking straight up into his captor's face. A thought struck him.\n\n\"Do you really enjoy this sort of thing?\" he asked suddenly.\n\nThe Vogon stopped dead and a look of immense stupidity seeped\nslowly over his face.\n\n\"Enjoy?\" he boomed. \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"What I mean\" said Ford, \"is does it give you a full satisfying\nlife? Stomping around, shouting, pushing people out of spaceships\n..\"\n\nThe Vogon stared up at the low steel ceiling and his eyebrows\nalmost rolled over each other. His mouth slacked. Finally he\nsaid, \"Well the hours are good ..\"\n\n\"They'd have to be\" agreed Ford.\n\nArthur twisted his head to look at Ford.\n\n\"Ford, what are you doing?\" he asked in an amazed whisper.\n\n\"Oh, just trying to take an interest in the world around me, OK?\"\nhe said. \"So the hours are pretty good then?\" he resumed.\n\nThe Vogon stared down at him as sluggish thoughts moiled around\nin the murky depths.\n\n\"Yeah\" he said, \"but now you come to mention it, most of the\nactual minutes are pretty lousy. Except ..\" he thought again,\nwhich required looking at the ceiling \"except some of the\nshouting I quite like\" He filled his lungs and bellowed,\n\"Resistance is ..\"\n\n\"Sure, yes\" interrupted Ford hurriedly, \"you're good at that, I\ncan tell. But if it's mostly lousy\" he said, slowly giving the\nwords time to reach their mark, \"then why do you do it? What is\nit? The girls? The leather? The machismo? Or do you just find\nthat coming to terms with the mindless tedium of it all presents\nan interesting challenge?\"\n\n\"Er ..\" said the guard, \"er ... er ... I dunno. I think I just\nsort of ... do it really. My aunt said that spaceship guard was a\ngood career for a young Vogon you know, the uniform, the low \nslung stun ray holster, the mindless tedium ..\"\n\n\"There you are Arthur\" said Ford with the air of someone\nreaching the conclusion of his argument, \"you think you've got\nproblems\"\n\nArthur rather thought he had. Apart from the unpleasant business\nwith his home planet the Vogon guard had half throttled him\nalready and he didn't like the sound of being thrown into space\nvery much.\n\n\"Try and understand his problem\" insisted Ford. \"Here he is poor\nlad, his entire life's work is stamping around, throwing people\noff spaceships ..\"\n\n\"And shouting\" added the guard.\n\n\"And shouting, sure\" said Ford patting the blubbery arm clamped\nround his neck in friendly condescension, \"... and he doesn't\neven know why he's doing it!\"\n\nArthur agreed this was very sad. He did this with a small feeble\ngesture, because he was too asphyxicated to speak.\n\nDeep rumblings of bemusement came from the guard.\n\n\"Well. Now you put it like that I suppose ..\"\n\n\"Good lad!\" encouraged Ford.\n\n\"But alright\" went on the rumblings, \"so what's the\nalternative?\"\n\n\"Well\" said Ford, brightly but slowly, \"stop doing it of course!\nTell them\" he went on, \"you're not going to do it anymore\" He\nfelt he had to add something to that, but for the moment the\nguard seemed to have his mind occupied pondering that much.\n\n\"Eerrrrrrmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm ..\" said the guard, \n\"erm, well that doesn't sound that great to me\"\n\nFord suddenly felt the moment slipping away.\n\n\"Now wait a minute\" he said, \"that's just the start you see,\nthere's more to it than that you see ..\"\n\nBut at that moment the guard renewed his grip and continued his\noriginal purpose of lugging his prisoners to the airlock. He was\nobviously quite touched.\n\n\"No, I think if it's all the same to you\" he said, \"I'd better\nget you both shoved into this airlock and then go and get on with\nsome other bits of shouting I've got to do\"\n\nIt wasn't all the same to Ford Prefect after all.\n\n\"Come on now ... but look!\" he said, less slowly, less brightly.\n\"Huhhhhgggggggnnnnnnn ..\" said Arthur without any clear\ninflection.\n\n\"But hang on\" pursued Ford, \"there's music and art and things to\ntell you about yet! Arrrggghhh!\"\n\n\"Resistance is useless\" bellowed the guard, and then added, \"You\nsee if I keep it up I can eventually get promoted to Senior\nShouting Officer, and there aren't usually many vacancies for\nnon shouting and non pushing people about officers, so I think\nI'd better stick to what I know\"\n\nThey had now reached the airlock a large circular steel\nhatchway of massive strength and weight let into the inner skin\nof the craft. The guard operated a control and the hatchway swung\nsmoothly open.\n\n\"But thanks for taking an interest\" said the Vogon guard. \"Bye\nnow\" He flung Ford and Arthur through the hatchway into the\nsmall chamber within. Arthur lay panting for breath. Ford\nscrambled round and flung his shoulder uselessly against the\nreclosing hatchway.\n\n\"But listen\" he shouted to the guard, \"there's a whole world you\ndon't know anything about ... here how about this?\" Desperately\nhe grabbed for the only bit of culture he knew offhand he\nhummed the first bar of Beethoven's Fifth.\n\n\"Da da da dum! Doesn't that stir anything in you?\"\n\n\"No\" said the guard, \"not really. But I'll mention it to my\naunt\"\n\nIf he said anything further after that it was lost. The hatchway\nsealed itself tight, and all sound was lost but the faint distant\nhum of the ship's engines.\n\nThey were in a brightly polished cylindrical chamber about six\nfeet in diameter and ten feet long.\n\n\"Potentially bright lad I thought\" he said and slumped against\nthe curved wall.\n\nArthur was still lying in the curve of the floor where he had\nfallen. He didn't look up. He just lay panting.\n\n\"We're trapped now aren't we?\"\n\n\"Yes\" said Ford, \"we're trapped\"\n\n\"Well didn't you think of anything? I thought you said you were\ngoing to think of something. Perhaps you thought of something and\ndidn't notice\"\n\n\"Oh yes, I thought of something\" panted Ford. Arthur looked up\nexpectantly.\n\n\"But unfortunately\" continued Ford, \"it rather involved being on\nthe other side of this airtight hatchway\" He kicked the hatch\nthey'd just been through.\n\n\"But it was a good idea was it?\"\n\n\"Oh yes, very neat\"\n\n\"What was it?\"\n\n\"Well I hadn't worked out the details yet. Not much point now is\nthere?\"\n\n\"So ... er, what happens next?\"\n\n\"Oh, er, well the hatchway in front of us will open automatically\nin a few moments and we will shoot out into deep space I expect\nand asphyxicate. If you take a lungful of air with you you can\nlast for up to thirty seconds of course ..\" said Ford. He stuck\nhis hands behind his back, raised his eyebrows and started to hum\nan old Betelgeusian battle hymn. To Arthur's eyes he suddenly\nlooked very alien.\n\n\"So this is it\" said Arthur, \"we're going to die\"\n\n\"Yes\" said Ford, \"except ... no! Wait a minute!\" he suddenly\nlunged across the chamber at something behind Arthur's line of\nvision. \"What's this switch?\" he cried.\n\n\"What? Where?\" cried Arthur twisting round.\n\n\"No, I was only fooling\" said Ford, \"we are going to die after\nall\"\n\nHe slumped against the wall again and carried on the tune from\nwhere he left off.\n\n\"You know\" said Arthur, \"it's at times like this, when I'm\ntrapped in a Vogon airlock with a man from Betelgeuse, and about\nto die of asphyxication in deep space that I really wish I'd\nlistened to what my mother told me when I was young\"\n\n\"Why, what did she tell you?\"\n\n\"I don't know, I didn't listen\"\n\n\"Oh\" Ford carried on humming.\n\n\"This is terrific\" Arthur thought to himself, \"Nelson's Column\nhas gone, McDonald's have gone, all that's left is me and the\nwords Mostly Harmless. Any second now all that will be left is\nMostly Harmless. And yesterday the planet seemed to be going so\nwell\"\n\nA motor whirred.\n\nA slight hiss built into a deafening roar of rushing air as the\nouter hatchway opened on to an empty blackness studded with tiny\nimpossibly bright points of light. Ford and Arthur popped into\nouter space like corks from a toy gun.\n\n\n\n\nThe Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a wholly remarkable\nbook. It has been compiled and recompiled many times over many\nyears and under many different editorships. It contains\ncontributions from countless numbers of travellers and\nresearchers.\n\nThe introduction begins like this:\n\n\"Space\" it says, \"is big. Really big. You just won't believe how\nvastly hugely mindboggingly big it is. I mean you may think it's\na long way down the road to the chemist, but that's just peanuts\nto space. Listen ..\" and so on.\n\n(After a while the style settles down a bit and it begins to tell\nyou things you really need to know, like the fact that the\nfabulously beautiful planet Bethselamin is now so worried about\nthe cumulative erosion by ten billion visiting tourists a year\nthat any net imbalance between the amount you eat and the amount\nyou excrete whilst on the planet is surgically removed from your\nbodyweight when you leave: so every time you go to the lavatory\nit is vitally important to get a receipt.)\n\nTo be fair though, when confronted by the sheer enormity of\ndistances between the stars, better minds than the one\nresponsible for the Guide's introduction have faltered. Some\ninvite you to consider for a moment a peanut in reading and a\nsmall walnut in Johannesburg, and other such dizzying concepts.\n\nThe simple truth is that interstellar distances will not fit into\nthe human imagination.\n\nEven light, which travels so fast that it takes most races\nthousands of years to realize that it travels at all, takes time\nto journey between the stars. It takes eight minutes from the\nstar Sol to the place where the Earth used to be, and four years\nmore to arrive at Sol's nearest stellar neighbour, Alpha Proxima.\n\nFor light to reach the other side of the Galaxy, for it to reach\nDamogran for instance, takes rather longer: five hundred thousand\nyears.\n\nThe record for hitch hiking this distance is just under five\nyears, but you don't get to see much on the way.\n\nThe Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy says that if you hold a\nlungful of air you can survive in the total vacuum of space for\nabout thirty seconds. However it goes on to say that what with\nspace being the mind boggling size it is the chances of getting\npicked up by another ship within those thirty seconds are two to\nthe power of two hundred and sixty seven thousand seven hundred\nand nine to one against.\n\nBy a totally staggering coincidence that is also the telephone\nnumber of an Islington flat where Arthur once went to a very good\nparty and met a very nice girl whom he totally failed to get off\nwith she went off with a gatecrasher.\nThough the planet Earth, the Islington flat and the telephone\nhave all now been demolished, it is comforting to reflect that\nthey are all in some small way commemorated by the fact that\ntwenty nine seconds later Ford and Arthur were rescued.\n\n\n\n\nA computer chatted to itself in alarm as it noticed an airlock\nopen and close itself for no apparent reason.\n\nThis was because Reason was in fact out to lunch.\n\nA hole had just appeared in the Galaxy. It was exactly a\nnothingth of a second long, a nothingth of an inch wide, and\nquite a lot of million light years from end to end.\n\nAs it closed up lots of paper hats and party balloons fell out of\nit and drifted off through the universe. A team of seven three \nfoot high market analysts fell out of it and died, partly of\nasphyxication, partly of surprise.\n\nTwo hundred and thirty nine thousand lightly fried eggs fell out\nof it too, materializing in a large woobly heap on the famine \nstruck land of Poghril in the Pansel system.\n\nThe whole Poghril tribe had died out from famine except for one\nlast man who died of cholesterol poisoning some weeks later.\n\nThe nothingth of a second for which the hole existed reverberated\nbackwards and forwards through time in a most improbable fashion.\nSomewhere in the deeply remote past it seriously traumatized a\nsmall random group of atoms drifting through the empty sterility\nof space and made them cling together in the most extraordinarily\nunlikely patterns. These patterns quickly learnt to copy\nthemselves (this was part of what was so extraordinary of the\npatterns) and went on to cause massive trouble on every planet\nthey drifted on to. That was how life began in the Universe.\n\nFive wild Event Maelstroms swirled in vicious storms of unreason\nand spewed up a pavement.\n\nOn the pavement lay Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent gulping like\nhalf spent fish.\n\n\"There you are\" gasped Ford, scrabbling for a fingerhold on the\npavement as it raced through the Third Reach of the Unknown, \"I\ntold you I'd think of something\"\n\n\"Oh sure\" said Arthur, \"sure\"\n\n\"Bright idea of mine\" said Ford, \"to find a passing spaceship\nand get rescued by it\"\n\nThe real universe arched sickeningly away beneath them. Various\npretend ones flitted silently by, like mountain goats. Primal\nlight exploded, splattering space time as with gobbets of junket.\nTime blossomed, matter shrank away. The highest prime number\ncoalesced quietly in a corner and hid itself away for ever.\n\n\"Oh come off it\" said Arthur, \"the chances against it were\nastronomical\"\n\n\"Don't knock it, it worked\" said Ford.\n\n\"What sort of ship are we in?\" asked Arthur as the pit of\neternity yawned beneath them.\n\n\"I don't know\" said Ford, \"I haven't opened my eyes yet\"\n\n\"No, nor have I\" said Arthur.\n\nThe Universe jumped, froze, quivered and splayed out in several\nunexpected directions.\n\nArthur and Ford opened their eyes and looked about in\nconsiderable surprise.\n\n\"Good god\" said Arthur, \"it looks just like the sea front at\nSouthend\"\n\n\"Hell, I'm relieved to hear you say that\" said Ford.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because I thought I must be going mad\"\n\n\"Perhaps you are. Perhaps you only thought I said it\"\n\nFord thought about this.\n\n\"Well, did you say it or didn't you?\" he asked.\n\n\"I think so\" said Arthur.\n\n\"Well, perhaps we're both going mad\"\n\n\"Yes\" said Arthur, \"we'd be mad, all things considered, to think\nthis was Southend\"\n\n\"Well, do you think this is Southend?\"\n\n\"Oh yes\"\n\n\"So do I\"\n\n\"Therefore we must be mad\"\n\n\"Nice day for it\"\n\n\"Yes\" said a passing maniac.\n\n\"Who was that?\" asked Arthur\n\n\"Who the man with the five heads and the elderberry bush full\nof kippers?\"\n\"Yes\"\n\n\"I don't know. Just someone\"\n\n\"Ah\"\n\nThey both sat on the pavement and watched with a certain unease\nas huge children bounced heavily along the sand and wild horses\nthundered through the sky taking fresh supplies of reinforced\nrailings to the Uncertain Areas.\n\n\"You know\" said Arthur with a slight cough, \"if this is\nSouthend, there's something very odd about it ..\"\n\n\"You mean the way the sea stays steady and the buildings keep\nwashing up and down?\" said Ford. \"Yes I thought that was odd too.\nIn fact\" he continued as with a huge bang Southend split itself\ninto six equal segments which danced and span giddily round each\nother in lewd and licentious formation, \"there is something\naltogether very strange going on\"\n\nWild yowling noises of pipes and strings seared through the wind,\nhot doughnuts popped out of the road for ten pence each, horrid\nfish stormed out of the sky and Arthur and Ford decided to make a\nrun for it.\n\nThey plunged through heavy walls of sound, mountains of archaic \nthought, valleys of mood music, bad shoe sessions and footling\nbats and suddenly heard a girl's voice.\n\nIt sounded quite a sensible voice, but it just said, \"Two to the\npower of one hundred thousand to one against and falling\" and\nthat was all.\n\nFord skidded down a beam of light and span round trying to find a\nsource for the voice but could see nothing he could seriously\nbelieve in.\n\n\"What was that voice?\" shouted Arthur.\n\n\"I don't know\" yelled Ford, \"I don't know. It sounded like a\nmeasurement of probability\"\n\n\"Probability? What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Probability. You know, like two to one, three to one, five to\nfour against. It said two to the power of one hundred thousand to\none against. That's pretty improbable you know\"\n\nA million gallon vat of custard upended itself over them without\nwarning.\n\n\"But what does it mean?\" cried Arthur.\n\n\"What, the custard?\"\n\n\"No, the measurement of probability!\"\n\n\"I don't know. I don't know at all. I think we're on some kind of\nspaceship\"\n\n\"I can only assume\" said Arthur, \"that this is not the first \nclass compartment\"\n\nBulges appeared in the fabric of space time. Great ugly bulges.\n\n\"Haaaauuurrgghhh ..\" said Arthur as he felt his body softening\nand bending in unusual directions. \"Southend seems to be melting\naway ... the stars are swirling ... a dustbowl ... my legs are\ndrifting off into the sunset ... my left arm's come off too\" A\nfrightening thought struck him: \"Hell\" he said, \"how am I going\nto operate my digital watch now?\" He wound his eyes desperately\naround in Ford's direction.\n\n\"Ford\" he said, \"you're turning into a penguin. Stop it\"\n\nAgain came the voice.\n\n\"Two to the power of seventy five thousand to one against and\nfalling\"\n\nFord waddled around his pond in a furious circle.\n\n\"Hey, who are you\" he quacked. \"Where are you? What's going on\nand is there any way of stopping it?\"\n\n\"Please relax\" said the voice pleasantly, like a stewardess in\nan airliner with only one wing and two engines one of which is on\nfire, \"you are perfectly safe\"\n\n\"But that's not the point!\" raged Ford. \"The point is that I am\nnow a perfectly save penguin, and my colleague here is rapidly\nrunning out of limbs!\"\n\n\"It's alright, I've got them back now\" said Arthur.\n\n\"Two to the power of fifty thousand to one against and falling\"\nsaid the voice.\n\n\"Admittedly\" said Arthur, \"they're longer than I usually like\nthem, but ..\"\n\n\"Isn't there anything\" squawked Ford in avian fury, \"you feel\nyou ought to be telling us?\"\n\nThe voice cleared its throat. A giant petit four lolloped off\ninto the distance.\n\n\"Welcome\" the voice said, \"to the Starship Heart of Gold\"\n\nThe voice continued.\n\n\"Please do not be alarmed\" it said, \"by anything you see or hear\naround you. You are bound to feel some initial ill effects as you\nhave been rescued from certain death at an improbability level of\ntwo to the power of two hundred and seventy six thousand to one\nagainst possibly much higher. We are now cruising at a level of\ntwo to the power of twenty five thousand to one against and\nfalling, and we will be restoring normality just as soon as we\nare sure what is normal anyway. Thank you. Two to the power of\ntwenty thousand to one against and falling\"\n\nThe voice cut out.\n\nFord and Arthur were in a small luminous pink cubicle.\n\nFord was wildly excited.\n\n\"Arthur!\" he said, \"this is fantastic! We've been picked up by a\nship powered by the Infinite Improbability Drive! This is\nincredible! I heard rumors about it before! They were all\nofficially denied, but they must have done it! They've built the\nImprobability Drive! Arthur, this is ... Arthur? What's\nhappening?\"\n\nArthur had jammed himself against the door to the cubicle, trying\nto hold it closed, but it was ill fitting. Tiny furry little\nhands were squeezing themselves through the cracks, their fingers\nwere inkstained; tiny voices chattered insanely.\n\nArthur looked up.\n\n\"Ford!\" he said, \"there's an infinite number of monkeys outside\nwho want to talk to us about this script for Hamlet they've\nworked out\"\n\n\n\n\nThe Infinite Improbability Drive is a wonderful new method of\ncrossing vast interstellar distances in a mere nothingth of a\nsecond, without all that tedious mucking about in hyperspace.\n\nIt was discovered by a lucky chance, and then developed into a\ngovernable form of propulsion by the Galactic Government's\nresearch team on Damogran.\n\nThis, briefly, is the story of its discovery.\n\nThe principle of generating small amounts of finite improbability\nby simply hooking the logic circuits of a Bambleweeny 57 Sub \nMeson Brain to an atomic vector plotter suspended in a strong\nBrownian Motion producer (say a nice hot cup of tea) were of\ncourse well understood and such generators were often used to\nbreak the ice at parties by making all the molecules in the\nhostess's undergarments leap simultaneously one foot to the left,\nin accordance with the Theory of Indeterminacy.\n\nMany respectable physicists said that they weren't going to stand\nfor this partly because it was a debasement of science, but\nmostly because they didn't get invited to those sort of parties.\n\nAnother thing they couldn't stand was the perpetual failure they\nencountered in trying to construct a machine which could generate\nthe infinite improbability field needed to flip a spaceship\nacross the mind paralysing distances between the furthest stars,\nand in the end they grumpily announced that such a machine was\nvirtually impossible.\n\nThen, one day, a student who had been left to sweep up the lab\nafter a particularly unsuccessful party found himself reasoning\nthis way:\n\nIf, he thought to himself, such a machine is a virtual\nimpossibility, then it must logically be a finite improbability.\nSo all I have to do in order to make one is to work out exactly\nhow improbable it is, feed that figure into the finite\nimprobability generator, give it a fresh cup of really hot tea\n... and turn it on!\n\nHe did this, and was rather startled to discover that he had\nmanaged to create the long sought after golden Infinite\nImprobability generator out of thin air.\n\nIt startled him even more when just after he was awarded the\nGalactic Institute's Prize for Extreme Cleverness he got lynched\nby a rampaging mob of respectable physicists who had finally\nrealized that the one thing they really couldn't stand was a\nsmartass.\n\n\n\n\nThe Improbability proof control cabin of the Heart of Gold looked\nlike a perfectly conventional spaceship except that it was\nperfectly clean because it was so new. Some of the control seats\nhadn't had the plastic wrapping taken off yet. The cabin was\nmostly white, oblong, and about the size of a smallish\nrestaurant. In fact it wasn't perfectly oblong: the two long\nwalls were raked round in a slight parallel curve, and all the\nangles and corners were contoured in excitingly chunky shapes.\nThe truth of the matter is that it would have been a great deal\nsimpler and more practical to build the cabin as an ordinary\nthree dimensional oblong rom, but then the designers would have\ngot miserable. As it was the cabin looked excitingly purposeful,\nwith large video screens ranged over the control and guidance\nsystem panels on the concave wall, and long banks of computers\nset into the convex wall. In one corner a robot sat humped, its\ngleaming brushed steel head hanging loosely between its gleaming\nbrushed steel knees. It too was fairly new, but though it was\nbeautifully constructed and polished it somehow looked as if the\nvarious parts of its more or less humanoid body didn't quite fit\nproperly. In fact they fitted perfectly well, but something in\nits bearing suggested that they might have fitted better.\n\nZaphod Beeblebrox paced nervously up and down the cabin, brushing\nhis hands over pieces of gleaming equipment and giggling with\nexcitement.\n\nTrillian sat hunched over a clump of instruments reading off\nfigures. Her voice was carried round the Tannoy system of the\nwhole ship.\n\n\"Five to one against and falling ..\" she said, \"four to one\nagainst and falling ... three to one ... two ... one ...\nprobability factor of one to one ... we have normality, I repeat\nwe have normality\" She turned her microphone off then turned\nit back on, with a slight smile and continued: \"Anything you\nstill can't cope with is therefore your own problem. Please\nrelax. You will be sent for soon\"\n\nZaphod burst out in annoyance: \"Who are they Trillian?\"\n\nTrillian span her seat round to face him and shrugged.\n\n\"Just a couple of guys we seem to have picked up in open space\"\nshe said. \"Section ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha\"\n\n\"Yeah, well that's a very sweet thought Trillian\" complained\nZaphod, \"but do you really think it's wise under the\ncircumstances? I mean, here we are on the run and everything, we\nmust have the police of half the Galaxy after us by now, and we\nstop to pick up hitch hikers. OK, so ten out of ten for style,\nbut minus several million for good thinking, yeah?\"\n\nHe tapped irritably at a control panel. Trillian quietly moved\nhis hand before he tapped anything important. Whatever Zaphod's\nqualities of mind might include dash, bravado, conceit he was\nmechanically inept and could easily blow the ship up with an\nextravagant gesture. Trillian had come to suspect that the main\nreason why he had had such a wild and successful life that he\nnever really understood the significance of anything he did.\n\n\"Zaphod\" she said patiently, \"they were floating unprotected in\nopen space ... you wouldn't want them to have died would you?\"\n\n\"Well, you know ... no. Not as such, but ..\"\n\n\"Not as such? Not die as such? But?\" Trillian cocked her head on\none side.\n\n\"Well, maybe someone else might have picked them up later\"\n\n\"A second later and they would have been dead\"\n\n\"Yeah, so if you'd taken the trouble to think about the problem a\nbit longer it would have gone away\"\n\n\"You'd been happy to let them die?\"\n\n\"Well, you know, not happy as such, but ..\"\n\n\"Anyway\" said Trillian, turning back to the controls, \"I didn't\npick them up\"\n\n\"What do you mean? Who picked them up then?\"\n\n\"The ship did\"\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"The ship did. All by itself\"\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\"Whilst we were in Improbability Drive\"\n\n\"But that's incredible\"\n\n\"No Zaphod. Just very very improbable\"\n\n\"Er, yeah\"\n\n\"Look Zaphod\" she said, patting his arm, \"don't worry about the\naliens. They're just a couple of guys I expect. I'll send the\nrobot down to get them and bring them up here. Hey Marvin!\"\n\nIn the corner, the robot's head swung up sharply, but then\nwobbled about imperceptibly. It pulled itself up to its feet as\nif it was about five pounds heavier that it actually was, and\nmade what an outside observer would have thought was a heroic\neffort to cross the room. It stopped in front of Trillian and\nseemed to stare through her left shoulder.\n\n\"I think you ought to know I'm feeling very depressed\" it said.\nIts voice was low and hopeless.\n\n\"Oh God\" muttered Zaphod and slumped into a seat.\n\n\"Well\" said Trillian in a bright compassionate tone, \"here's\nsomething to occupy you and keep your mind off things\"\n\n\"It won't work\" droned Marvin, \"I have an exceptionally large\nmind\"\n\n\"Marvin!\" warned Trillian.\n\n\"Alright\" said Marvin, \"what do you want me to do?\"\n\n\"Go down to number two entry bay and bring the two aliens up here\nunder surveillance\"\n\nWith a microsecond pause, and a finely calculated micromodulation\nof pitch and timbre nothing you could actually take offence at\n Marvin managed to convey his utter contempt and horror of all\nthings human.\n\n\"Just that?\" he said.\n\n\"Yes\" said Trillian firmly.\n\n\"I won't enjoy it\" said Marvin.\n\nZaphod leaped out of his seat.\n\n\"She's not asking you to enjoy it\" he shouted, \"just do it will\nyou?\"\n\n\"Alright\" said Marvin like the tolling of a great cracked bell,\n\"I'll do it\"\n\n\"Good ..\" snapped Zaphod, \"great ... thank you ..\"\n\nMarvin turned and lifted his flat topped triangular red eyes up\ntowards him.\n\n\"I'm not getting you down at all am I?\" he said pathetically.\n\n\"No no Marvin\" lilted Trillian, \"that's just fine, really ..\"\n\n\"I wouldn't like to think that I was getting you down\"\n\n\"No, don't worry about that\" the lilt continued, \"you just act\nas comes naturally and everything will be just fine\"\n\n\"You're sure you don't mind?\" probed Marvin.\n\n\"No no Marvin\" lilted Trillian, \"that's just fine, really ...\njust part of life\"\n\n\"Marvin flashed him an electronic look.\n\n\"Life\" said Marvin, \"don't talk to me about life\"\n\nHe turned hopelessly on his heel and lugged himself out of the\ncabin. With a satisfied hum and a click the door closed behind\nhim\n\n\"I don't think I can stand that robot much longer Zaphod\"\ngrowled Trillian.\n\nThe Encyclopaedia Galactica defines a robot as a mechanical\napparatus designed to do the work of a man. The marketing\ndivision of the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation defines a robot as\n\"Your Plastic Pal Who's Fun To Be With\"\n\nThe Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy defines the marketing\ndivision of the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation as \"a bunch of\nmindless jerks who'll be the first against the wall when the\nrevolution comes\" with a footnote to the effect that the editors\nwould welcome applications from anyone interested in taking over\nthe post of robotics correspondent.\n\nCuriously enough, an edition of the Encyclopaedia Galactica that\nhad the good fortune to fall through a time warp from a thousand\nyears in the future defined the marketing division of the Sirius\nCybernetics Corporation as \"a bunch of mindless jerks who were\nthe first against the wall when the revolution came\"\n\nThe pink cubicle had winked out of existence, the monkeys had\nsunk away to a better dimension. Ford and Arthur found themselves\nin the embarkation area of the ship. It was rather smart.\n\n\"I think the ship's brand new\" said Ford.\n\n\"How can you tell?\" asked Arthur. \"Have you got some exotic\ndevice for measuring the age of metal?\"\n\n\"No, I just found this sales brochure lying on the floor. It's a\nlot of `the Universe can be yours' stuff. Ah! Look, I was right\"\n\nFord jabbed at one of the pages and showed it to Arthur.\n\"It says: Sensational new breakthrough in Improbability Physics.\nAs soon as the ship's drive reaches Infinite Improbability it\npasses through every point in the Universe. Be the envy of other\nmajor governments. Wow, this is big league stuff\"\n\nFord hunted excitedly through the technical specs of the ship,\noccasionally gasping with astonishment at what he read clearly\nGalactic astrotechnology had moved ahead during the years of his\nexile.\n\nArthur listened for a short while, but being unable to understand\nthe vast majority of what Ford was saying he began to let his\nmind wander, trailing his fingers along the edge of an\nincomprehensible computer bank, he reached out and pressed an\ninvitingly large red button on a nearby panel. The panel lit up\nwith the words Please do not press this button again. He shook\nhimself.\n\n\"Listen\" said Ford, who was still engrossed in the sales\nbrochure, \"they make a big thing of the ship's cybernetics. A new\ngeneration of Sirius Cybernetics Corporation robots and\ncomputers, with the new GPP feature\"\n\n\"GPP feature?\" said Arthur. \"What's that?\"\n\n\"Oh, it says Genuine People Personalities\"\n\n\"Oh\" said Arthur, \"sounds ghastly\"\n\nA voice behind them said, \"It is\" The voice was low and hopeless\nand accompanied by a slight clanking sound. They span round and\nsaw an abject steel man standing hunched in the doorway.\n\n\"What?\" they said.\n\n\"Ghastly\" continued Marvin, \"it all is. Absolutely ghastly. Just\ndon't even talk about it. Look at this door\" he said, stepping\nthrough it. The irony circuits cut into his voice modulator as he\nmimicked the style of the sales brochure. \"All the doors in this\nspaceship have a cheerful and sunny disposition. It is their\npleasure to open for you, and their satisfaction to close again\nwith the knowledge of a job well done\"\n\nAs the door closed behind them it became apparent that it did\nindeed have a satisfied sigh like quality to it.\n\"Hummmmmmmyummmmmmm ah!\" it said.\n\nMarvin regarded it with cold loathing whilst his logic circuits\nchattered with disgust and tinkered with the concept of directing\nphysical violence against it Further circuits cut in saying, Why\nbother? What's the point? Nothing is worth getting involved in.\nFurther circuits amused themselves by analysing the molecular\ncomponents of the door, and of the humanoids' brain cells. For a\nquick encore they measured the level of hydrogen emissions in the\nsurrounding cubic parsec of space and then shut down again in\nboredom. A spasm of despair shook the robot's body as he turned.\n\n\"Come on\" he droned, \"I've been ordered to take you down to the\nbridge. Here I am, brain the size of a planet and they ask me to\ntake you down to the bridge. Call that job satisfaction? 'Cos I\ndon't\"\n\nHe turned and walked back to the hated door.\n\n\"Er, excuse me\" said Ford following after him, \"which government\nowns this ship?\"\n\nMarvin ignored him.\n\n\"You watch this door\" he muttered, \"it's about to open again. I\ncan tell by the intolerable air of smugness it suddenly\ngenerates\"\n\nWith an ingratiating little whine the door slit open again and\nMarvin stomped through.\n\n\"Come on\" he said.\n\nThe others followed quickly and the door slit back into place\nwith pleased little clicks and whirrs.\n\n\"Thank you the marketing division of the Sirius Cybernetics\nCorporation\" said Marvin and trudged desolately up the gleaming\ncurved corridor that stretched out before them. \"Let's build\nrobots with Genuine People Personalities\" they said. So they\ntried it out with me. I'm a personality prototype. You can tell\ncan't you?\"\n\nFord and Arthur muttered embarrassed little disclaimers.\n\n\"I hate that door\" continued Marvin. \"I'm not getting you down\nat all am I?\"\n\n\"Which government ..\" started Ford again.\n\n\"No government owns it\" snapped the robot, \"it's been stolen\"\n\n\"Stolen?\"\n\n\"Stolen?\" mimicked Marvin.\n\n\"Who by?\" asked Ford.\n\n\"Zaphod Beeblebrox\"\n\nSomething extraordinary happened to Ford's face. At least five\nentirely separate and distinct expressions of shock and amazement\npiled up on it in a jumbled mess. His left leg, which was in mid\nstride, seemed to have difficulty in finding the floor again. He\nstared at the robot and tried to entangle some dartoid muscles.\n\n\"Zaphod Beeblebrox ...?\" he said weakly.\n\n\"Sorry, did I say something wrong?\" said Marvin, dragging himself\non regardless. \"Pardon me for breathing, which I never do anyway\nso I don't know why I bother to say it, oh God I'm so depressed.\nHere's another of those self satisfied door. Life! Don't talk to\nme about life\"\n\"No one ever mentioned it\" muttered Arthur irritably. \"Ford, are\nyou alright?\"\n\nFord stared at him. \"Did that robot say Zaphod Beeblebrox?\" he\nsaid.\n\n\n\n\nA loud clatter of gunk music flooded through the Heart of Gold\ncabin as Zaphod searched the sub etha radio wavebands for news of\nhimself. The machine was rather difficult to operate. For years\nradios had been operated by means of pressing buttons and turning\ndials; then as the technology became more sophisticated the\ncontrols were made touch sensitive you merely had to brush the\npanels with your fingers; now all you had to do was wave your\nhand in the general direction of the components and hope. It\nsaved a lot of muscular expenditure of course, but meant that you\nhad to sit infuriatingly still if you wanted to keep listening to\nthe same programme.\n\nZaphod waved a hand and the channel switched again. More gunk\nmusic, but this time it was a background to a news announcement.\nThe news was always heavily edited to fit the rhythms of the\nmusic.\n\n\"... and news brought to you here on the sub etha wave band,\nbroadcasting around the galaxy around the clock\" squawked a\nvoice, \"and we'll be saying a big hello to all intelligent life\nforms everywhere ... and to everyone else out there, the secret\nis to bang the rocks together, guys. And of course, the big news\nstory tonight is the sensational theft of the new Improbability\nDrive prototype ship by none other than Galactic President Zaphod\nBeeblebrox. And the question everyone's asking is ... has the big\nZ finally flipped? Beeblebrox, the man who invented the Pan\nGalactic Gargle Blaster, ex confidence trickster, once described\nby Eccentrica Gallumbits as the Best Bang since the Big One, and\nrecently voted the Wort Dressed Sentinent Being in the Known\nUniverse for the seventh time ... has he got an answer this time?\nWe asked his private brain care specialist Gag Halfrunt ..\" The\nmusic swirled and dived for a moment. Another voice broke in,\npresumably Halfrunt. He said: \"Vell, Zaphod's jist zis guy you\nknow?\" but got no further because an electric pencil flew across\nthe cabin and through the radio's on/off sensitive airspace.\nZaphod turned and glared at Trillian she had thrown the pencil.\n\n\"Hey\" he said, what do you do that for?\"\n\nTrillian was tapping her fingers on a screenful of figures.\n\n\"I've just thought of something\" she said.\n\n\"Yeah? Worth interrupting a news bulletin about me for?\"\n\n\"You hear enough about yourself as it is\"\n\n\"I'm very insecure. We know that\"\n\"Can we drop your ego for a moment? This is important\"\n\n\"If there's anything more important than my ego around, I want it\ncaught and shot now\" Zaphod glared at her again, then laughed.\n\n\"Listen\" she said, \"we picked up those couple of guys ..\"\n\n\"What couple of guys?\"\n\n\"The couple of guys we picked up\"\n\n\"Oh, yeah\" said Zaphod, \"those couple of guys\"\n\n\"We picked them up in sector ZZ 9 Plural Z Alpha\"\n\n\"Yeah?\" said Zaphod and blinked.\n\nTrillian said quietly, \"Does that mean anything to you?\"\n\n\"Mmmmm\" said Zaphod, \"ZZ 9 Plural Z Alpha. ZZ 9 Plural Z Alpha?\"\n\n\"Well?\" said Trillian.\n\n\"Er ... what does the Z mean?\" said Zaphod.\n\n\"Which one?\"\n\n\"Any one\"\n\nOne of the major difficulties Trillian experienced in her\nrelationship with Zaphod was learning to distinguish between him\npretending to be stupid just to get people off their guard,\npretending to be stupid because he couldn't be bothered to think\nand wanted someone else to do it for him, pretending to be\noutrageously stupid to hide the fact that he actually didn't\nunderstand what was going on, and really being genuinely stupid.\nHe was renowned for being amazingly clever and quite clearly was\nso but not all the time, which obviously worried him, hence the\nact. He proffered people to be puzzled rather than contemptuous.\nThis above all appeared to Trillian to be genuinely stupid, but\nshe could no longer be bothered to argue about it.\n\nShe sighed and punched up a star map on the visiscreen so she\ncould make it simple for him, whatever his reasons for wanting it\nto be that way.\n\n\"There\" she pointed, \"right there\"\n\n\"Hey ... Yeah!\" said Zaphod.\n\n\"Well?\" she said.\n\n\"Well what?\"\n\nParts of the inside of her head screamed at other parts of the\ninside of her head. She said, very calmly, \"It's the same sector\nyou originally picked me up in\"\n\nHe looked at her and then looked back at the screen.\n\"Hey, yeah\" he said, \"now that is wild. We should have zapped\nstraight into the middle of the Horsehead Nebula. How did we come\nto be there? I mean that's nowhere\"\n\nShe ignored this.\n\n\"Improbability Drive\" she said patiently. \"You explained it to\nme yourself. We pass through every point in the Universe, you\nknow that\"\n\n\"Yeah, but that's one wild coincidence isn't it?\"\n\n\"Yes\"\n\n\"Picking someone up at that point? Out of the whole of the\nUniverse to choose from? That's just too ... I want to work this\nout. Computer!\"\n\nThe Sirius Cybernetics Corporation Shipboard Computer which\ncontrolled and permeated every particle of the ship switched\ninto communication mode.\n\n\"Hi there!\" it said brightly and simultaneously spewed out a tiny\nribbon of ticker tape just for the record. The ticker tape said,\nHi there!\n\n\"Oh God\" said Zaphod. He hadn't worked with this computer for\nlong but had already learned to loathe it.\n\nThe computer continued, brash and cheery as if it was selling\ndetergent.\n\n\"I want you to know that whatever your problem, I am here to help\nyou solve it\"\n\n\"Yeah yeah\" said Zaphod. \"Look, I think I'll just use a piece of\npaper\"\n\n\"Sure thing\" said the computer, spilling out its message into a\nwaste bin at the same time, \"I understand. If you ever want ..\"\n\n\"Shut up!\" said Zaphod, and snatching up a pencil sat down next\nto Trillian at the console.\n\n\"OK, OK ..\" said the computer in a hurt tone of voice and closed\ndown its speech channel again.\n\nZaphod and Trillian pored over the figures that the Improbability\nflight path scanner flashed silently up in front of them.\n\n\"Can we work out\" said Zaphod, \"from their point of view what\nthe Improbability of their rescue was?\"\n\n\"Yes, that's a constant\", said Trillian, \"two to the power of two\nhundred and seventy six thousand seven hundred and nine to one\nagainst\"\n\n\"That's high. They're two lucky lucky guys\"\n\"Yes\"\n\n\"But relative to what we were doing when the ship picked them up\n..\"\n\nTrillian punched up the figures. They showed tow to the power \nof Infinity minus one (an irrational number that only has a\nconventional meaning in Improbability physics).\n\n\"... it's pretty low\" continued Zaphod with a slight whistle.\n\n\"Yes\" agreed Trillian, and looked at him quizzically.\n\n\"That's one big whack of Improbability to be accounted for.\nSomething pretty improbable has got to show up on the balance\nsheet if it's all going to add up into a pretty sum\"\n\nZaphod scribbled a few sums, crossed them out and threw the\npencil away.\n\n\"Bat's dots, I can't work it out\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\nZaphod knocked his two heads together in irritation and gritted\nhis teeth.\n\n\"OK\" he said. \"Computer!\"\n\nThe voice circuits sprang to life again.\n\n\"Why hello there!\" they said (ticker tape, ticker tape). \"All I\nwant to do is make your day nicer and nicer and nicer ..\"\n\n\"Yeah well shut up and work something out for me\"\n\n\"Sure thing\" chattered the computer, \"you want a probability\nforecast based on ..\"\n\n\"Improbability data, yeah\"\n\n\"OK\" the computer continued. \"Here's an interesting little\nnotion. Did you realize that most people's lives are governed by\ntelephone numbers?\"\n\nA pained look crawled across one of Zaphod's faces and on to the\nother one.\n\n\"Have you flipped?\" he said.\n\n\"No, but you will when I tell you that ..\"\n\nTrillian gasped. She scrabbled at the buttons on the\nImprobability flight path screen.\n\n\"Telephone number?\" she said. \"Did that thing say telephone\nnumber?\"\nNumbers flashed up on the screen.\n\nThe computer had paused politely, but now it continued.\n\n\"What I was about to say was that ..\"\n\n\"Don't bother please\" said Trillian.\n\n\"Look, what is this?\" said Zaphod.\n\n\"I don't know\" said Trillian, \"but those aliens they're on the\nway up to the bridge with that wretched robot. Can we pick them\nup on any monitor cameras?\"\n\n\n\n\nMarvin trudged on down the corridor, still moaning.\n\n\"... and then of course I've got this terrible pain in all the\ndiodes down my left hand side ..\"\n\n\"No?\" said Arthur grimly as he walked along beside him. \"Really?\"\n\n\"Oh yes\" said Marvin, \"I mean I've asked for them to be replaced\nbut no one ever listens\"\n\n\"I can imagine\"\n\nVague whistling and humming noises were coming from Ford. \"Well\nwell well\" he kept saying to himself, \"Zaphod Beeblebrox ..\"\n\nSuddenly Marvin stopped, and held up a hand.\n\n\"You know what's happened now of course?\"\n\n\"No, what?\" said Arthur, who didn't what to know.\n\n\"We've arrived at another of those doors\"\n\nThere was a sliding door let into the side of the corridor.\nMarvin eyed it suspiciously.\n\n\"Well?\" said Ford impatiently. \"Do we go through?\"\n\n\"Do we go through?\" mimicked Marvin. \"Yes. This is the entrance\nto the bridge. I was told to take you to the bridge. Probably the\nhighest demand that will be made on my intellectual capacities\ntoday I shouldn't wonder\"\n\nSlowly, with great loathing, he stepped towards the door, like a\nhunter stalking his prey. Suddenly it slid open.\n\n\"Thank you\" it said, \"for making a simple door very happy\"\n\nDeep in Marvin's thorax gears ground.\n\n\"Funny\" he intoned funerally, \"how just when you think life\ncan't possibly get any worse it suddenly does\"\nHe heaved himself through the door and left Ford and Arthur\nstaring at each other and shrugging their shoulders. From inside\nthey heard Marvin's voice again.\n\n\"I suppose you want to see the aliens now\" he said. \"Do you want\nme to sit in a corner and rust, or just fall apart where I'm\nstanding?\"\n\n\"Yeah, just show them in would you Marvin?\" came another voice.\n\nArthur looked at Ford and was astonished to see him laughing.\n\n\"What's ...?\"\n\n\"Shhh\" said Ford, \"come in\"\n\nHe stepped through into the bridge.\n\nArthur followed him in nervously and was astonished to see a man\nlolling back in a chair with his feet on a control console\npicking the teeth in his right hand head with his left hand. The\nright hand head seemed to be thoroughly preoccupied with this\ntask, but the left hand one was grinning a broad, relaxed,\nnonchalant grin. The number of things that Arthur couldn't\nbelieve he was seeing was fairly large. His jaw flapped about at\na loose end for a while.\n\nThe peculiar man waved a lazy wave at Ford and with an appalling\naffectation of nonchalance said, \"Ford, hi, how are you? Glad you\ncould drop in\"\n\nFord was not going to be outcooled.\n\n\"Zaphod\" he drawled, \"great to see you, you're looking well, the\nextra arm suits you. Nice ship you've stolen\"\n\nArthur goggled at him.\n\n\"You mean you know this guy?\" he said, waving a wild finger at\nZaphod.\n\n\"Know him!\" exclaimed Ford, \"he's ..\" he paused, and decided to\ndo the introductions the other way round.\n\n\"Oh, Zaphod, this is a friend of mine, Arthur Dent\" he said, \"I\nsaved him when his planet blew up\"\n\n\"Oh sure\" said Zaphod, \"hi Arthur, glad you could make it\" His\nright hand head looked round casually, said \"hi\" and went back to\nhaving his teeth picked.\n\nFord carried on. \"And Arthur\" he said, \"this is my semi cousin\nZaphod Beeb ..\"\n\n\"We've met\" said Arthur sharply.\n\nWhen you're cruising down the road in the fast lane and you\nlazily sail past a few hard driving cars and are feeling pretty\npleased with yourself and then accidentally change down from\nfourth to first instead of third thus making your engine leap out\nof your bonnet in a rather ugly mess, it tends to throw you off\nyour stride in much the same way that this remark threw Ford\nPrefect off his.\n\n\"Err ... what?\"\n\n\"I said we've met\"\n\nZaphod gave an awkward start of surprise and jabbed a gum\nsharply.\n\n\"Hey ... er, have we? Hey ... er ..\"\n\nFord rounded on Arthur with an angry flash in his eyes. Now he\nfelt he was back on home ground he suddenly began to resent\nhaving lumbered himself with this ignorant primitive who knew as\nmuch about the affairs of the Galaxy as an Ilford based gnat knew\nabout life in Peking.\n\n\"What do you mean you've met?\" he demanded. \"This is Zaphod\nBeeblebrox from Betelgeuse Five you know, not bloody Martin Smith\nfrom Croydon\"\n\n\"I don't care\" said Arthur coldly. We've met, haven't we Zaphod\nBeeblebrox or should I say ... Phil?\"\n\n\"What!\" shouted Ford.\n\n\"You'll have to remind me\" said Zaphod. \"I've a terrible memory\nfor species\"\n\n\"It was at a party\" pursued Arthur.\n\n\"Yeah, well I doubt that\" said Zaphod.\n\n\"Cool it will you Arthur!\" demanded Ford.\n\nArthur would not be deterred. \"A party six months ago. On Earth\n... England ..\"\n\nZaphod shook his head with a tight lipped smile.\n\n\"London\" insisted Arthur, \"Islington\"\n\n\"Oh\" said Zaphod with a guilty start, \"that party\"\n\nThis wasn't fair on Ford at all. He looked backwards and forwards\nbetween Arthur and Zaphod. \"What?\" he said to Zaphod. \"You don't\nmean to say you've been on that miserable planet as well do you?\"\n\n\"No, of course not\" said Zaphod breezily. \"Well, I may have just\ndropped in briefly, you know, on my way somewhere ..\"\n\n\"But I was stuck there for fifteen years!\"\n\n\"Well I didn't know that did I?\"\n\"But what were you doing there?\"\n\n\"Looking about, you know\"\n\n\"He gatecrashed a party\" persisted Arthur, trembling with anger,\n\"a fancy dress party ..\"\n\n\"It would have to be, wouldn't it?\" said Ford.\n\n\"At this party\" persisted Arthur, \"was a girl ... oh well, look\nit doesn't matter now. The whole place has gone up in smoke\nanyway ..\"\n\n\"I wish you'd stop sulking about that bloody planet\" said Ford.\n\"Who was the lady?\"\n\n\"Oh just somebody. Well alright, I wasn't doing very well with\nher. I'd been trying all evening. Hell, she was something though.\nBeautiful, charming, devastatingly intelligent, at last I'd got\nher to myself for a bit and was plying her with a bit of talk\nwhen this friend of yours barges up and says Hey doll, is this\nguy boring you? Why don't you talk to me instead? I'm from a\ndifferent planet\" I never saw her again\"\n\n\"Zaphod?\" exclaimed Ford.\n\n\"Yes\" said Arthur, glaring at him and trying not to feel\nfoolish. \"He only had the two arms and the one head and he called\nhimself Phil, but ..\"\n\n\"But you must admit he did turn out to be from another planet\"\nsaid Trillian wandering into sight at the other end of the\nbridge. She gave Arthur a pleasant smile which settled on him\nlike a ton of bricks and then turned her attention to the ship's\ncontrols again.\n\nThere was silence for a few seconds, and then out of the\nscrambled mess of Arthur's brain crawled some words.\n\n\"Tricia McMillian?\" he said. \"What are you doing here?\"\n\n\"Same as you\" she said, \"I hitched a lift. After all with a\ndegree in Maths and another in astrophysics what else was there\nto do? It was either that or the dole queue again on Monday\"\n\n\"Infinity minus one\" chattered the computer, \"Improbability sum\nnow complete\"\n\nZaphod looked about him, at Ford, at Arthur, and then at\nTrillian.\n\n\"Trillian\" he said, \"is this sort of thing going to happen every\ntime we use the Improbability drive?\"\n\n\"Very probably, I'm afraid\" she said.\n\n\n\n\nThe Heart of Gold fled on silently through the night of space,\nnow on conventional photon drive. Its crew of four were ill at\nease knowing that they had been brought together not of their own\nvolition or by simple coincidence, but by some curious principle\nof physics as if relationships between people were susceptible\nto the same laws that governed the relationships between atoms\nand molecules.\n\nAs the ship's artificial night closed in they were each grateful\nto retire to separate cabins and try to rationalize their\nthoughts.\n\nTrillian couldn't sleep. She sat on a couch and stared at a small\ncage which contained her last and only links with Earth two\nwhite mice that she had insisted Zaphod let her bring. She had\nexpected not to see the planet again, but she was disturbed by\nher negative reaction to the planet's destruction. It seemed\nremote and unreal and she could find no thoughts to think about\nit. She watched the mice scurrying round the cage and running\nfuriously in their little plastic treadwheels till they occupied\nher whole attention. Suddenly she shook herself and went back to\nthe bridge to watch over the tiny flashing lights and figures\nthat charted the ship's progress through the void. She wished she\nknew what it was she was trying not to think about.\n\nZaphod couldn't sleep. He also wished he knew what it was that he\nwouldn't let himself think about. For as long as he could\nremember he'd suffered from a vague nagging feeling of being not\nall there. Most of the time he was able to put this thought aside\nand not worry about it, but it had been re awakened by the sudden\ninexplicable arrival of Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent. Somehow it\nseemed to conform to a pattern that he couldn't see.\n\nFord couldn't sleep. He was too excited about being back on the\nroad again. Fifteen years of virtual imprisonment were over, just\nas he was finally beginning to give up hope. Knocking about with\nZaphod for a bit promised to be a lot of fun, though there seemed\nto be something faintly odd about his semi cousin that he\ncouldn't put his finger on. The fact that he had become President\nof the Galaxy was frankly astonishing, as was the manner of his\nleaving the post. Was there a reason behind it? There would be no\npoint in asking Zaphod, he never appeared to have a reason for\nanything he did at all: he had turned unfathomably into an art\nform. He attacked everything in life with a mixture of\nextraordinary genius and naive incompetence and it was often\ndifficult to tell which was which.\n\nArthur slept: he was terribly tired.\n\nThere was a tap at Zaphod's door. It slid open.\n\n\"Zaphod ...?\"\n\n\"Yeah?\"\n\n\"I think we just found what you came to look for\"\n\n\"Hey, yeah?\"\nFord gave up the attempt to sleep. In the corner of his cabin was\na small computer screen and keyboard. He sat at it for a while\nand tried to compose a new entry for the Guide on the subject of\nVogons but couldn't think of anything vitriolic enough so he gave\nthat up too, wrapped a robe round himself and went for a walk to\nthe bridge.\n\nAs he entered he was surprised to see two figures hunched\nexcitedly over the instruments.\n\n\"See? The ship's about to move into orbit\" Trillian was saying.\n\"There's a planet out there. It's at the exact coordinates you\npredicted\"\n\nZaphod heard a noise and looked up.\n\n\"Ford!\" he hissed. \"Hey, come and take a look at this\"\n\nFord went and had a look at it. It was a series of figures\nflashing over a screen.\n\n\"You recognize those Galactic coordinates?\" said Zaphod.\n\n\"No\"\n\n\"I'll give you a clue. Computer!\"\n\n\"Hi gang!\" enthused the computer. \"This is getting real sociable\nisn't it?\"\n\n\"Shut up\" said Zaphod, \"and show up the screens\"\n\nLight on the bridge sank. Pinpoints of light played across the\nconsoles and reflected in four pairs of eyes that stared up at\nthe external monitor screens.\n\nThere was absolutely nothing on them.\n\n\"Recognize that?\" whispered Zaphod.\n\nFord frowned.\n\n\"Er, no\" he said.\n\n\"What do you see?\"\n\n\"Nothing\"\n\n\"Recognize it?\"\n\n\"What are you talking about?\"\n\n\"We're in the Horsehead Nebula. One whole vast dark cloud\"\n\n\"And I was meant to recognize that from a blank screen?\"\n\n\"Inside a dark nebula is the only place in the Galaxy you'd see a\ndark screen\"\n\"Very good\"\n\nZaphod laughed. He was clearly very excited about something,\nalmost childishly so.\n\n\"Hey, this is really terrific, this is just far too much!\"\n\n\"What's so great about being stuck in a dust cloud?\" said Ford.\n\n\"What would you reckon to find here?\" urged Zaphod.\n\n\"Nothing\"\n\n\"No stars? No planets?\"\n\n\"No\"\n\n\"Computer!\" shouted Zaphod, \"rotate angle of vision through one \neighty degrees and don't talk about it!\"\n\nFor a moment it seemed that nothing was happening, then a\nbrightness glowed at the edge of the huge screen. A red star the\nsize of a small plate crept across it followed quickly by another\none a binary system. Then a vast crescent sliced into the\ncorner of the picture a red glare shading away into the deep\nblack, the night side of the planet.\n\n\"I've found it!\" cried Zaphod, thumping the console. \"I've found\nit!\"\n\nFord stared at it in astonishment.\n\n\"What is it?\" he said.\n\n\"That ..\" said Zaphod, \"is the most improbable planet that ever\nexisted\"\n\n\n\n\n(Excerpt from The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Page 634784,\nSection 5a, Entry: Magrathea)\n\nFar back in the mists of ancient time, in the great and glorious\ndays of the former Galactic Empire, life was wild, rich and\nlargely tax free.\n\nMighty starships plied their way between exotic suns, seeking\nadventure and reward amongst the furthest reaches of Galactic\nspace. In those days spirits were brave, the stakes were high,\nmen were real men, women were real women, and small furry\ncreatures from Alpha Centauri were real small furry creatures\nfrom Alpha Centauri. And all dared to brave unknown terrors, to\ndo mighty deeds, to boldly split infinitives that no man had\nsplit before and thus was the Empire forged.\n\nMany men of course became extremely rich, but this was perfectly\nnatural and nothing to be ashamed of because no one was really\npoor at least no one worth speaking of. And for all the richest\nand most successful merchants life inevitably became rather dull\nand niggly, and they began to imagine that this was therefore the\nfault of the worlds they'd settled on none of them was entirely\nsatisfactory: either the climate wasn't quite right in the later\npart of the afternoon, or the day was half an hour too long, or\nthe sea was exactly the wrong shade of pink.\n\nAnd thus were created the conditions for a staggering new form of\nspecialist industry: custom made luxury planet building. The home\nof this industry was the planet Magrathea, where hyperspatial\nengineers sucked matter through white holes in space to form it\ninto dream planets gold planets, platinum planets, soft rubber\nplanets with lots of earthquakes all lovingly made to meet the\nexacting standards that the Galaxy's richest men naturally came\nto expect.\n\nBut so successful was this venture that Magrathea itself soon\nbecame the richest planet of all time and the rest of the Galaxy\nwas reduced to abject poverty. And so the system broke down, the\nEmpire collapsed, and a long sullen silence settled over a\nbillion worlds, disturbed only by the pen scratchings of scholars\nas they laboured into the night over smug little treaties on the\nvalue of a planned political economy.\n\nMagrathea itself disappeared and its memory soon passed into the\nobscurity of legend.\n\nIn these enlightened days of course, no one believes a word of\nit.\n\n\n\n\nArthur awoke to the sound of argument and went to the bridge.\nFord was waving his arms about.\n\n\"You're crazy, Zaphod\" he was saying, \"Magrathea is a myth, a\nfairy story, it's what parents tell their kids about at night if\nthey want them to grow up to become economists, it's ..\"\n\n\"And that's what we are currently in orbit around\" insisted\nZaphod.\n\n\"Look, I can't help what you may personally be in orbit around\"\nsaid Ford, \"but this ship ..\"\n\n\"Computer!\" shouted Zaphod.\n\n\"Oh no ..\"\n\n\"Hi there! This is Eddie your shipboard computer, and I'm feeling\njust great guys, and I know I'm just going to get a bundle of\nkicks out of any programme you care to run through me\"\n\nArthur looked inquiringly at Trillian. She motioned him to come\non in but keep quiet.\n\n\"Computer\" said Zaphod, \"tell us again what our present\ntrajectory is\"\n\"A real pleasure feller\" it burbled, \"we are currently in orbit\nat an altitude of three hundred miles around the legendary planet\nof Magrathea\"\n\n\"Proving nothing\" said Ford. \"I wouldn't trust that computer to\nspeak my weight\"\n\n\"I can do that for you, sure\" enthused the computer, punching\nout more tickertape. \"I can even work out you personality\nproblems to ten decimal places if it will help\"\n\nTrillian interrupted.\n\n\"Zaphod\" she said, \"any minute now we will be swinging round to\nthe daylight side of this planet\" adding, \"whatever it turns out\nto be\"\n\n\"Hey, what do you mean by that? The planet's where I predicted it\nwould be isn't it?\"\n\n\"Yes, I know there's a planet there. I'm not arguing with anyone,\nit's just that I wouldn't know Magrathea from any other lump of\ncold rock. Dawn's coming up if you want it\"\n\n\"OK, OK\" muttered Zaphod, \"let's at least give our eyes a good\ntime. Computer!\"\n\n\"Hi there! What can I ..\"\n\n\"Just shut up and give us a view of the planet again\"\n\nA dark featureless mass once more filled the screens the planet\nrolling away beneath them.\n\nThey watched for a moment in silence, but Zaphod was fidgety with\nexcitement.\n\n\"We are now traversing the night side ..\" he said in a hushed\nvoice. The planet rolled on.\n\n\"The surface of the planet is now three hundred miles beneath us\n..\" he continued. He was trying to restore a sense of occasion\nto what he felt should have been a great moment. Magrathea! He\nwas piqued by Ford's sceptical reaction. Magrathea!\n\n\"In a few seconds\" he continued, \"we should see ... there!\"\n\nThe moment carried itself. Even the most seasoned star tramp\ncan't help but shiver at the spectacular drama of a sunrise seen\nfrom space, but a binary sunrise is one of the marvels of the\nGalaxy.\n\nOut of the utter blackness stabbed a sudden point of blinding\nlight. It crept up by slight degrees and spread sideways in a\nthin crescent blade, and within seconds two suns were visible,\nfurnaces of light, searing the black edge of the horizon with\nwhite fire. Fierce shafts of colour streaked through the thin\natmosphere beneath them.\n\"The fires of dawn ... !\" breathed Zaphod. \"The twin suns of\nSoulianis and Rahm ... !\"\n\n\"Or whatever\" said Ford quietly.\n\n\"Soulianis and Rahm!\" insisted Zaphod.\n\nThe suns blazed into the pitch of space and a low ghostly music\nfloated through the bridge: Marvin was humming ironically because\nhe hated humans so much.\n\nAs Ford gazed at the spectacle of light before them excitement\nburnt inside him, but only the excitement of seeing a strange new\nplanet, it was enough for him to see it as it was. It faintly\nirritated him that Zaphod had to impose some ludicrous fantasy on\nto the scene to make it work for him. All this Magrathea nonsense\nseemed juvenile. Isn't it enough to see that a garden is\nbeautiful without having to believe that there are fairies at the\nbottom of it too?\n\nAll this Magrathea business seemed totally incomprehensible to\nArthur. He edged up to Trillian and asked her what was going on.\n\n\"I only know what Zaphod's told me\" she whispered. \"Apparently\nMagrathea is some kind of legend from way back which no one\nseriously believes in. Bit like Atlantis on Earth, except that\nthe legends say the Magratheans used to manufacture planets\"\n\nArthur blinked at the screens and felt he was missing something\nimportant. Suddenly he realized what it was.\n\n\"Is there any tea on this spaceship?\" he asked.\n\nMore of the planet was unfolding beneath them as the Heart of\nGold streaked along its orbital path. The suns now stood high in\nthe black sky, the pyrotechnics of dawn were over, and the\nsurface of the planet appeared bleak and forbidding in the common\nlight of day grey, dusty and only dimly contoured. It looked\ndead and cold as a crypt. From time to time promising features\nwould appear on the distant horizon ravines, maybe mountains,\nmaybe even cities but as they approached the lines would soften\nand blur into anonymity and nothing would transpire. The planet's\nsurface was blurred by time, by the slow movement of the thin\nstagnant air that had crept across it for century upon century.\n\nClearly, it was very very old.\n\nA moment of doubt came to Ford as he watched the grey landscape\nmove beneath them. The immensity of time worried him, he could\nfeel it as a presence. He cleared his throat.\n\n\"Well, even supposing it is ..\"\n\n\"It is\" said Zaphod.\n\n\"Which it isn't\" continued Ford. \"What do you want with it\nanyway? There's nothing there\"\n\"Not on the surface\" said Zaphod.\n\n\"Alright, just supposing there's something. I take it you're not\nhere for the sheer industrial archaeology of it all. What are you\nafter?\"\n\nOne of Zaphod's heads looked away. The other one looked round to\nsee what the first was looking at, but it wasn't looking at\nanything very much.\n\n\"Well\" said Zaphod airily, \"it's partly the curiosity, partly a\nsense of adventure, but mostly I think it's the fame and the\nmoney ..\"\n\nFord glanced at him sharply. He got a very strong impression that\nZaphod hadn't the faintest idea why he was there at all.\n\n\"You know I don't like the look of that planet at all\" said\nTrillian shivering.\n\n\"Ah, take no notice\" said Zaphod, \"with half the wealth of the\nformer Galactic Empire stored on it somewhere it can afford to\nlook frumpy\"\n\nBullshit, thought Ford. Even supposing this was the home of some\nancient civilization now gone to dust, even supposing a number of\nexceedingly unlikely things, there was no way that vast treasures\nof wealth were going to be stored there in any form that would\nstill have meaning now. He shrugged.\n\n\"I think it's just a dead planet\" he said.\n\n\"The suspense is killing me\" said Arthur testily.\n\nStress and nervous tension are now serious social problems in all\nparts of the Galaxy, and it is in order that this situation\nshould not in any way be exacerbated that the following facts\nwill now be revealed in advance.\n\nThe planet in question is in fact the legendary Magrathea.\n\nThe deadly missile attack shortly to be launched by an ancient\nautomatic defence system will result merely in the breakage of\nthree coffee cups and a micecage, the bruising of somebody's\nupper arm, and the untimely creation and sudden demise of a bowl\nof petunias and an innocent sperm whale.\n\nIn order that some sense of mystery should still be preserved, no\nrevelation will yet be made concerning whose upper arm sustained\nthe bruise. This fact may safely be made the subject of suspense\nsince it is of no significance whatsoever.\n\n\n\n\nAfter a fairly shaky start to the day, Arthur's mind was\nbeginning to reassemble itself from the shellshocked fragments\nthe previous day had left him with. He had found a Nutri Matic\nmachine which had provided him with a plastic cup filled with a\nliquid that was almost, but not quite, entirely unlike tea. The\nway it functioned was very interesting. When the Drink button was\npressed it made an instant but highly detailed examination of the\nsubject's taste buds, a spectroscopic analysis of the subject's\nmetabolism and then sent tiny experimental signals down the\nneural pathways to the taste centres of the subject's brain to\nsee what was likely to go down well. However, no one knew quite\nwhy it did this because it invariably delivered a cupful of\nliquid that was almost, but not quite, entirely unlike tea. The\nNutri Matic was designed and manufactured by the Sirius\nCybernetics Corporation whose complaints department now covers\nall the major land masses of the first three planets in the\nSirius Tau Star system.\n\nArthur drank the liquid and found it reviving. He glanced up at\nthe screens again and watched a few more hundred miles of barren\ngreyness slide past. It suddenly occurred to him to ask a\nquestion which had been bothering him.\n\n\"Is it safe?\" he said.\n\n\"Magrathea's been dead for five million years\" said Zaphod, \"of\ncourse it's safe. Even the ghosts will have settled down and\nraised families by now\" At which point a strange and\ninexplicable sound thrilled suddenly through the bridge a noise\nas of a distant fanfare; a hollow, reedy, insubstantial sound. It\npreceded a voice that was equally hollow, reedy and\ninsubstantial. The voice said \"Greetings to you ..\"\n\nSomeone from the dead planet was talking to them.\n\n\"Computer!\" shouted Zaphod.\n\n\"Hi there!\"\n\n\"What the photon is it?\"\n\n\"Oh, just some five million year old tape that's being broadcast\nat us\"\n\n\"A what? A recording?\"\n\n\"Shush!\" said Ford. \"It's carrying on\"\n\nThe voice was old, courteous, almost charming, but was\nunderscored with quite unmistakable menace.\n\n\"This is a recorded announcement\" it said, \"as I'm afraid we're\nall out at the moment. The commercial council of Magrathea thanks\nyou for your esteemed visit ..\"\n\n(\"A voice from ancient Magrathea!\" shouted Zaphod. \"OK, OK\" said\nFord.)\n\n\"... but regrets\" continued the voice, \"that the entire planet\nis temporarily closed for business. Thank you. If you would care\nto leave your name and the address of a planet where you can be\ncontacted, kindly speak when you hear the tone\"\nA short buzz followed, then silence.\n\n\"They want to get rid of us\" said Trillian nervously. \"What do\nwe do?\"\n\n\"It's just a recording\" said Zaphod. \"We keep going. Got that,\ncomputer?\"\n\n\"I got it\" said the computer and gave the ship an extra kick of\nspeed.\n\nThey waited.\n\nAfter a second or so came the fanfare once again, and then the\nvoice.\n\n\"We would like to assure you that as soon as our business is\nresumed announcements will be made in all fashionable magazines\nand colour supplements, when our clients will once again be able\nto select from all that's best in contemporary geography\" The\nmenace in the voice took on a sharper edge. \"Meanwhile we thank\nour clients for their kind interest and would ask them to leave.\nNow\"\n\nArthur looked round the nervous faces of his companions.\n\n\"Well, I suppose we'd better be going then, hadn't we?\" he\nsuggested.\n\n\"Shhh!\" said Zaphod. \"There's absolutely nothing to be worried\nabout\"\n\n\"Then why's everyone so tense?\"\n\n\"They're just interested!\" shouted Zaphod. \"Computer, start a\ndescent into the atmosphere and prepare for landing\"\n\nThis time the fanfare was quite perfunctory, the voice distinctly\ncold.\n\n\"It is most gratifying\" it said, \"that your enthusiasm for our\nplanet continues unabated, and so we would like to assure you\nthat the guided missiles currently converging with your ship are\npart of a special service we extend to all of our most\nenthusiastic clients, and the fully armed nuclear warheads are of\ncourse merely a courtesy detail. We look forward to your custom\nin future lives ... thank you\"\n\nThe voice snapped off.\n\n\"Oh\" said Trillian.\n\n\"Er ..\" said Arthur.\n\n\"Well?\" said Ford.\n\n\"Look\" said Zaphod, \"will you get it into your heads? That's\njust a recorded message. It's millions of years old. It doesn't\napply to us, get it?\"\n\"What\" said Trillian quietly, \"about the missiles?\"\n\n\"Missiles? Don't make me laugh\"\n\nFord tapped Zaphod on the shoulder and pointed at the rear\nscreen. Clear in the distance behind them two silver darts were\nclimbing through the atmosphere towards the ship. A quick change\nof magnification brought them into close focus two massively\nreal rockets thundering through the sky. The suddenness of it was\nshocking.\n\n\"I think they're going to have a very good try at applying to\nus\" said Ford.\n\nZaphod stared at them in astonishment.\n\n\"Hey this is terrific!\" he said. \"Someone down there is trying to\nkill us!\"\n\n\"Terrific\" said Arthur.\n\n\"But don't you see what this means?\"\n\n\"Yes. We're going to die\"\n\n\"Yes, but apart from that\"\n\n\"Apart from that?\"\n\n\"It means we must be on to something!\"\n\n\"How soon can we get off it?\"\n\nSecond by second the image of the missiles on the screen became\nlarger. They had swung round now on to a direct homing course so\nthat all that could be seen of them now was the warheads, head\non.\n\n\"As a matter of interest\" said Trillian, \"what are we going to\ndo?\"\n\n\"Just keep cool\" said Zaphod.\n\n\"Is that all?\" shouted Arthur.\n\n\"No, we're also going to ... er ... take evasive action!\" said\nZaphod with a sudden access of panic. \"Computer, what evasive\naction can we take?\"\n\n\"Er, none I'm afraid, guys\" said the computer.\n\n\"... or something\" said Zaphod, \"... er ..\" he said.\n\n\"There seems to be something jamming my guidance system\"\nexplained the computer brightly, \"impact minus forty five\nseconds. Please call me Eddie if it will help you to relax\"\n\nZaphod tried to run in several equally decisive directions\nsimultaneously. \"Right!\" he said. \"Er ... we've got to get manual\ncontrol of this ship\"\n\n\"Can you fly her?\" asked Ford pleasantly.\n\n\"No, can you?\"\n\n\"No\"\n\n\"Trillian, can you?\"\n\n\"No\"\n\n\"Fine\" said Zaphod, relaxing. \"We'll do it together\"\n\n\"I can't either\" said Arthur, who felt it was time he began to\nassert himself.\n\n\"I'd guessed that\" said Zaphod. \"OK computer, I want full manual\ncontrol now\"\n\n\"You got it\" said the computer.\n\nSeveral large desk panels slid open and banks of control consoles\nsprang up out of them, showering the crew with bits of expanded\npolystyrene packaging and balls of rolled up cellophane: these\ncontrols had never been used before.\n\nZaphod stared at them wildly.\n\n\"OK, Ford\" he said, \"full retro thrust and ten degrees\nstarboard. Or something ..\"\n\n\"Good luck guys\" chirped the computer, \"impact minus thirty\nseconds ..\"\n\nFord leapt to the controls only a few of them made any\nimmediate sense to him so he pulled those. The ship shook and\nscreamed as its guidance rocked jets tried to push it every which\nway simultaneously. He released half of them and the ship span\nround in a tight arc and headed back the way it had come,\nstraight towards the oncoming missiles.\n\nAir cushions ballooned out of the walls in an instant as everyone\nwas thrown against them. For a few seconds the inertial forces\nheld them flattened and squirming for breath, unable to move.\nZaphod struggled and pushed in manic desperation and finally\nmanaged a savage kick at a small lever that formed part of the\nguidance system.\n\nThe lever snapped off. The ship twisted sharply and rocketed\nupwards. The crew were hurled violently back across the cabin.\nFord's copy of The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy smashed into\nanother section of the control console with the combined result\nthat the guide started to explain to anyone who cared to listen\nabout the best ways of smuggling Antarean parakeet glands out of\nAntares (an Antarean parakeet gland stuck on a small stick is a\nrevolting but much sought after cocktail delicacy and very large\nsums of money are often paid for them by very rich idiots who\nwant to impress other very rich idiots), and the ship suddenly\ndropped out of the sky like a stone.\n\nIt was of course more or less at this moment that one of the crew\nsustained a nasty bruise to the upper arm. This should be\nemphasized because, as had already been revealed, they escape\notherwise completely unharmed and the deadly nuclear missiles do\nnot eventually hit the ship. The safety of the crew is absolutely\nassured.\n\n\"Impact minus twenty seconds, guys ..\" said the computer.\n\n\"Then turn the bloody engines back on!\" bawled Zaphod.\n\n\"OK, sure thing, guys\" said the computer. With a subtle roar the\nengines cut back in, the ship smoothly flattened out of its dive\nand headed back towards the missiles again.\n\nThe computer started to sing.\n\n\"When you walk through the storm ..\" it whined nasally, \"hold\nyour head up high ..\"\n\nZaphod screamed at it to shut up, but his voice was lost in the\ndin of what they quite naturally assumed was approaching\ndestruction.\n\n\"And don't ... be afraid ... of the dark!\" Eddie wailed.\n\nThe ship, in flattening out had in fact flattened out upside down\nand lying on the ceiling as they were it was now totally\nimpossible for any of the crew to reach the guidance systems.\n\n\"At the end of the storm ..\" crooned Eddie.\n\nThe two missiles loomed massively on the screens as they\nthundered towards the ship.\n\n\"... is a golden sky ..\"\n\nBut by an extraordinarily lucky chance they had not yet fully\ncorrected their flight paths to that of the erratically weaving\nship, and they passed right under it.\n\n\"And the sweet silver songs of the lark ... Revised impact time\nfifteen seconds fellas ... Walk on through the wind ..\"\n\nThe missiles banked round in a screeching arc and plunged back\ninto pursuit.\n\n\"This is it\" said Arthur watching them. \"We are now quite\ndefinitely going to die aren't we?\"\n\n\"I wish you'd stop saying that\" shouted Ford.\n\n\"Well we are aren't we?\"\n\n\"Yes\"\n\"Walk on through the rain ..\" sang Eddie.\n\nA thought struck Arthur. He struggled to his feet.\n\n\"Why doesn't anyone turn on this Improbability Drive thing?\" he\nsaid. \"We could probably reach that\"\n\n\"What are you crazy?\" said Zaphod. \"Without proper programming\nanything could happen\"\n\n\"Does that matter at this stage?\" shouted Arthur.\n\n\"Though your dreams be tossed and blown ..\" sand Eddie.\n\nArthur scrambled up on to one end of the excitingly chunky pieces\nof moulded contouring where the curve of the wall met the\nceiling.\n\n\"Walk on, walk on, with hope in your heart ..\"\n\n\"Does anyone know why Arthur can't turn on the Improbability\nDrive?\" shouted Trillian.\n\n\"And you'll never walk alone ... Impact minus five seconds, it's\nbeen great knowing you guys, God bless ... You'll ne ... ver ...\nwalk ... alone!\"\n\n\"I said\" yelled Trillian, \"does anyone know ..\"\n\nThe next thing that happened was a mid mangling explosion of\nnoise and light.\n\n\n\n\nAnd the next thing that happened after that was that the Heart of\nGold continued on its way perfectly normally with a rather\nfetchingly redesigned interior. It was somewhat larger, and done\nout in delicate pastel shades of green and blue. In the centre a\nspiral staircase, leading nowhere in particular, stood in a spray\nof ferns and yellow flowers and next to it a stone sundial\npedestal housed the main computer terminal. Cunningly deployed\nlighting and mirrors created the illusion of standing in a\nconservatory overlooking a wide stretch of exquisitely manicured\ngarden. Around the periphery of the conservatory area stood\nmarble topped tables on intricately beautiful wrought iron legs.\nAs you gazed into the polished surface of the marble the vague\nforms of instruments became visible, and as you touched them the\ninstruments materialized instantly under your hands. Looked at\nfrom the correct angles the mirrors appeared to reflect all the\nrequired data readouts, though it was far from clear where they\nwere reflected from. It was in fact sensationally beautiful.\n\nRelaxing in a wickerwork sun chair, Zaphod Beeblebrox said, \"What\nthe hell happened?\"\n\n\"Well I was just saying\" said Arthur lounging by a small fish\npool, \"there's this Improbability Drive switch over here ..\" he\nwaved at where it had been. There was a potted plant there now.\n\"But where are we?\" said Ford who was sitting on the spiral\nstaircase, a nicely chilled Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster in his\nhand.\n\n\"Exactly where we were, I think ..\" said Trillian, as all about\nthem the mirrors showed them an image of the blighted landscape\nof Magrathea which still scooted along beneath them.\n\nZaphod leapt out of his seat.\n\n\"Then what's happened to the missiles?\" he said.\n\nA new and astounding image appeared in the mirrors.\n\n\"They would appear\" said Ford doubtfully, \"to have turned into a\nbowl of petunias and a very surprised looking whale ..\"\n\n\"At an Improbability Factor\" cut in Eddie, who hadn't changed a\nbit, \"of eight million seven hundred and sixty seven thousand one\nhundred and twenty eight to one against\"\n\nZaphod stared at Arthur.\n\n\"Did you think of that, Earthman?\" he demanded.\n\n\"Well\" said Arthur, \"all I did was ..\"\n\n\"That's very good thinking you know. Turn on the Improbability\nDrive for a second without first activating the proofing screens.\nHey kid you just saved our lives, you know that?\"\n\n\"Oh\" said Arthur, \"well, it was nothing really ..\"\n\n\"Was it?\" said Zaphod. \"Oh well, forget it then. OK, computer,\ntake us in to land\"\n\n\"But ..\"\n\n\"I said forget it\"\n\nAnother thing that got forgotten was the fact that against all\nprobability a sperm whale had suddenly been called into existence\nseveral miles above the surface of an alien planet.\n\nAnd since this is not a naturally tenable position for a whale,\nthis poor innocent creature had very little time to come to terms\nwith its identity as a whale before it then had to come to terms\nwith not being a whale any more.\n\nThis is a complete record of its thoughts from the moment it\nbegan its life till the moment it ended it.\n\nAh ... ! What's happening? it thought.\n\nEr, excuse me, who am I?\n\nHello?\nWhy am I here? What's my purpose in life?\n\nWhat do I mean by who am I?\n\nCalm down, get a grip now ... oh! this is an interesting\nsensation, what is it? It's a sort of ... yawning, tingling\nsensation in my ... my ... well I suppose I'd better start\nfinding names for things if I want to make any headway in what\nfor the sake of what I shall call an argument I shall call the\nworld, so let's call it my stomach.\n",

    "Not only is it a wholly remarkable book, it is also a highly\nsuccessful one more popular than the Celestial Home Care\nOmnibus, better selling than Fifty More Things to do in Zero\nGravity, and more controversial than Oolon Colluphid's trilogy of\nphilosophical blockbusters Where God Went Wrong, Some More of\nGod's Greatest Mistakes and Who is this God Person Anyway?",
    "In many of the more relaxed civilizations on the Outer Eastern\nRim of the Galaxy, the Hitch Hiker's Guide has already supplanted\nthe great Encyclopedia Galactica as the standard repository of\nall knowledge and wisdom, for though it has many omissions and\ncontains much that is apocryphal, or at least wildly inaccurate,\nit scores over the older, more pedestrian work in two important\nrespects.",
    "First, it is slightly cheaper; and secondly it has the words\nDon't Panic inscribed in large friendly letters on its cover.",
    "But the story of this terrible, stupid Thursday, the story of its\nextraordinary consequences, and the story of how these\nconsequences are inextricably intertwined with this remarkable\nbook begins very simply.\n\n It begins with a house.\n\n\n\n The house stood on a slight rise just on the edge of the village.",
    "It stood on its own and looked over a broad spread of West\nCountry farmland.",
    "Not a remarkable house by any means it was\nabout thirty years old, squattish, squarish, made of brick, and\nhad four windows set in the front of a size and proportion which\nmore or less exactly failed to please the eye.",
    "The only person for whom the house was in any way special was\nArthur Dent, and that was only because it happened to be the one\nhe lived in.",
    "He had lived in it for about three years, ever since\nhe had moved out of London because it made him nervous and\nirritable.  He was about thirty as well, dark haired and never \nquite at ease with himself.",
    "The thing that used to worry him most\nwas the fact that people always used to ask him what he was\nlooking so worried about.  He worked in local radio which he\nalways used to tell his friends was a lot more interesting than\nthey probably thought.",
    "It was, too most of his friends worked\nin advertising.\n\n It hadn't properly registered with Arthur that the council wanted\nto knock down his house and build an bypass instead.\n\n At eight o'clock on Thursday morning Arthur didn't feel very\ngood.",
    "He woke up blearily, got up, wandered blearily round his\nroom, opened a window, saw a bulldozer, found his slippers, and\nstomped off to the bathroom to wash.\n\n Toothpaste on the brush so.  Scrub.\n\n Shaving mirror pointing at the ceiling.  He adjusted it.",
    "For a\nmoment it reflected a second bulldozer through the bathroom\nwindow.  Properly adjusted, it reflected Arthur Dent's bristles.\n He shaved them off, washed, dried, and stomped off to the kitchen\nto find something pleasant to put in his mouth.\n\n Kettle, plug, fridge, milk, coffee.  Yawn.",
    "The word bulldozer wandered through his mind for a moment in\nsearch of something to connect with.\n\n The bulldozer outside the kitchen window was quite a big one.\n\n He stared at it.\n\n \"Yellow\" he thought and stomped off back to his bedroom to get\ndressed.",
    "Passing the bathroom he stopped to drink a large glass of water,\nand another.  He began to suspect that he was hung over.  Why was\nhe hung over?  Had he been drinking the night before?  He supposed\nthat he must have been.  He caught a glint in the shaving mirror.",
    "\"Yellow\" he thought and stomped on to the bedroom.\n\n He stood and thought.  The pub, he thought.  Oh dear, the pub.  He\nvaguely remembered being angry, angry about something that seemed\nimportant.",
    "He'd been telling people about it, telling people\nabout it at great length, he rather suspected: his clearest\nvisual recollection was of glazed looks on other people's faces.\n Something about a new bypass he had just found out about.",
    "It had\nbeen in the pipeline for months only no one seemed to have known\nabout it.  Ridiculous.  He took a swig of water.  It would sort\nitself out, he'd decided, no one wanted a bypass, the council\ndidn't have a leg to stand on.  It would sort itself out.",
    "God what a terrible hangover it had earned him though.  He looked\nat himself in the wardrobe mirror.  He stuck out his tongue.\n \"Yellow\" he thought.  The word yellow wandered through his mind\nin search of something to connect with.",
    "Fifteen seconds later he was out of the house and lying in front\nof a big yellow bulldozer that was advancing up his garden path.\n Mr L Prosser was, as they say, only human.  In other words he was\na carbon based life form descended from an ape.",
    "More specifically\nhe was forty, fat and shabby and worked for the local council.",
    "Curiously enough, though he didn't know it, he was also a direct\nmale line descendant of Genghis Khan, though intervening\ngenerations and racial mixing had so juggled his genes that he\nhad no discernible Mongoloid characteristics, and the only\nvestiges left in Mr L Prosser of his mighty ancestry were a\npronounced stoutness about the tum and a predilection for little\nfur hats.",
    "He was by no means a great warrior: in fact he was a nervous\nworried man.",
    "Today he was particularly nervous and worried\nbecause something had gone seriously wrong with his job which\nwas to see that Arthur Dent's house got cleared out of the way\nbefore the day was out.\n\n \"Come off it, Mr Dent\", he said, \"you can't win you know.",
    "You\ncan't lie in front of the bulldozer indefinitely\" He tried to\nmake his eyes blaze fiercely but they just wouldn't do it.\n\n Arthur lay in the mud and squelched at him.",
    "\"I'm game\" he said, \"we'll see who rusts first\"\n\n\"I'm afraid you're going to have to accept it\" said Mr Prosser\ngripping his fur hat and rolling it round the top of his head,\n\"this bypass has got to be built and it's going to be built!",
    "\"\n\n\"First I've heard of it\" said Arthur, \"why's it going to be\nbuilt? \"\n\nMr Prosser shook his finger at him for a bit, then stopped and\nput it away again.\n\n \"What do you mean, why's it got to be built? \" he said.  \"It's a\nbypass.",
    "You've got to build bypasses\"\n\nBypasses are devices which allow some people to drive from point\nA to point B very fast whilst other people dash from point B to\npoint A very fast.",
    "People living at point C, being a point\ndirectly in between, are often given to wonder what's so great\nabout point A that so many people of point B are so keen to get\nthere, and what's so great about point B that so many people of\npoint A are so keen to get there.",
    "They often wish that people\nwould just once and for all work out where the hell they wanted\nto be.\n\n Mr Prosser wanted to be at point D.  Point D wasn't anywhere in\nparticular, it was just any convenient point a very long way from\npoints A, B and C.",
    "He would have a nice little cottage at point\nD, with axes over the door, and spend a pleasant amount of time\nat point E, which would be the nearest pub to point D.  His wife\nof course wanted climbing roses, but he wanted axes.",
    "He didn't\nknow why he just liked axes.  He flushed hotly under the\nderisive grins of the bulldozer drivers.\n\n He shifted his weight from foot to foot, but it was equally\nuncomfortable on each.  Obviously somebody had been appallingly\nincompetent and he hoped to God it wasn't him.",
    "Mr Prosser said: \"You were quite entitled to make any suggestions\nor protests at the appropriate time you know\"\n\n\"Appropriate time? \" hooted Arthur.  \"Appropriate time?  The first I\nknew about it was when a workman arrived at my home yesterday.",
    "I\nasked him if he'd come to clean the windows and he said no he'd\ncome to demolish the house.  He didn't tell me straight away of\ncourse.  Oh no.  First he wiped a couple of windows and charged me\na fiver.",
    "Then he told me\"\n\n\"But Mr Dent, the plans have been available in the local planning\noffice for the last nine month\"\n\n\"Oh yes, well as soon as I heard I went straight round to see\nthem, yesterday afternoon.",
    "You hadn't exactly gone out of your\nway to call attention to them had you?  I mean like actually\ntelling anybody or anything\"\n\n\"But the plans were on display.. \"\n\n\"On display?",
    "I eventually had to go down to the cellar to find\nthem\"\n\n\"That's the display department\"\n\n\"With a torch\"\n\n\"Ah, well the lights had probably gone\"\n\n\"So had the stairs\"\n\n\"But look, you found the notice didn't you? \"\n\n\"Yes\" said Arthur, \"yes I did.",
    "It was on display in the bottom\nof a locked filing cabinet stuck in a disused lavatory with a\nsign on the door saying Beware of the Leopard\"\n\nA cloud passed overhead.",
    "It cast a shadow over Arthur Dent as he\nlay propped up on his elbow in the cold mud.  It cast a shadow\nover Arthur Dent's house.  Mr Prosser frowned at it.\n\n \"It's not as if it's a particularly nice house\" he said.",
    "\"I'm sorry, but I happen to like it\"\n\n\"You'll like the bypass\"\n\n\"Oh shut up\" said Arthur Dent.  \"Shut up and go away, and take\nyour bloody bypass with you.",
    "You haven't got a leg to stand on\nand you know it\"\n\nMr Prosser's mouth opened and closed a couple of times while his\nmind was for a moment filled with inexplicable but terribly\nattractive visions of Arthur Dent's house being consumed with\nfire and Arthur himself running screaming from the blazing ruin\nwith at least three hefty spears protruding from his back.",
    "Mr\nProsser was often bothered with visions like these and they made\nhim feel very nervous.  He stuttered for a moment and then pulled\nhimself together.\n\n \"Mr Dent\" he said.\n\n \"Hello?  Yes? \" said Arthur.\n\n \"Some factual information for you.",
    "Have you any idea how much\ndamage that bulldozer would suffer if I just let it roll straight\nover you? \"\n\n\"How much? \" said Arthur.",
    "\"None at all\" said Mr Prosser, and stormed nervously off\nwondering why his brain was filled with a thousand hairy horsemen\nall shouting at him.",
    "By a curious coincidence, None at all is exactly how much\nsuspicion the ape descendant Arthur Dent had that one of his\nclosest friends was not descended from an ape, but was in fact\nfrom a small planet in the vicinity of Betelgeuse and not from\nGuildford as he usually claimed.",
    "Arthur Dent had never, ever suspected this.\n\n This friend of his had first arrived on the planet some fifteen\nEarth years previously, and he had worked hard to blend himself\ninto Earth society with, it must be said, some success.",
    "For\ninstance he had spent those fifteen years pretending to be an out\nof work actor, which was plausible enough.\n\n He had made one careless blunder though, because he had skimped a\nbit on his preparatory research.",
    "The information he had gathered\nhad led him to choose the name \"Ford Prefect\" as being nicely\ninconspicuous.\n\n He was not conspicuously tall, his features were striking but not\nconspicuously handsome.  His hair was wiry and gingerish and\nbrushed backwards from the temples.",
    "His skin seemed to be pulled\nbackwards from the nose.  There was something very slightly odd\nabout him, but it was difficult to say what it was.",
    "Perhaps it\nwas that his eyes didn't blink often enough and when you talked\nto him for any length of time your eyes began involuntarily to\nwater on his behalf.",
    "Perhaps it was that he smiled slightly too\nbroadly and gave people the unnerving impression that he was\nabout to go for their neck.\n\n He struck most of the friends he had made on Earth as an\neccentric, but a harmless one an unruly boozer with some\noddish habits.",
    "For instance he would often gatecrash university\nparties, get badly drunk and start making fun of any\nastrophysicist he could find till he got thrown out.",
    "Sometimes he would get seized with oddly distracted moods and\nstare into the sky as if hypnotized until someone asked him what\nhe was doing.  Then he would start guiltily for a moment, relax\nand grin.",
    "\"Oh, just looking for flying saucers\" he would joke and everyone\nwould laugh and ask him what sort of flying saucers he was\nlooking for.\n\n \"Green ones!",
    "\" he would reply with a wicked grin, laugh wildly for\na moment and then suddenly lunge for the nearest bar and buy an\nenormous round of drinks.\n\n Evenings like this usually ended badly.",
    "Ford would get out of his\nskull on whisky, huddle into a corner with some girl and explain\nto her in slurred phrases that honestly the colour of the flying\nsaucers didn't matter that much really.",
    "Thereafter, staggering semi paralytic down the night streets he\nwould often ask passing policemen if they knew the way to\nBetelgeuse.  The policemen would usually say something like,\n\"Don't you think it's about time you went off home sir?",
    "\"\n\n\"I'm trying to baby, I'm trying to\" is what Ford invariably\nreplied on these occasions.\n\n In fact what he was really looking out for when he stared\ndistractedly into the night sky was any kind of flying saucer at\nall.",
    "The reason he said green was that green was the traditional\nspace livery of the Betelgeuse trading scouts.\n\n Ford Prefect was desperate that any flying saucer at all would\narrive soon because fifteen years was a long time to get stranded\nanywhere, particularly somewhere as mindboggingly dull as the\nEarth.",
    "Ford wished that a flying saucer would arrive soon because he\nknew how to flag flying saucers down and get lifts from them.  He\nknew how to see the Marvels of the Universe for less than thirty\nAltairan dollars a day.",
    "In fact, Ford Prefect was a roving researcher for that wholly\nremarkable book The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy.\n\n Human beings are great adaptors, and by lunchtime life in the\nenvirons of Arthur's house had settled into a steady routine.",
    "It\nwas Arthur's accepted role to lie squelching in the mud making\noccasional demands to see his lawyer, his mother or a good book;\nit was Mr Prosser's accepted role to tackle Arthur with the\noccasional new ploy such as the For the Public Good talk, the\nMarch of Progress talk, the They Knocked My House Down Once You\nKnow, Never Looked Back talk and various other cajoleries and\nthreats; and it was the bulldozer drivers' accepted role to sit\naround drinking coffee and experimenting with union regulations\nto see how they could turn the situation to their financial\nadvantage.",
    "The Earth moved slowly in its diurnal course.\n\n The sun was beginning to dry out the mud Arthur lay in.\n\n A shadow moved across him again.\n\n \"Hello Arthur\" said the shadow.\n Arthur looked up and squinting into the sun was startled to see\nFord Prefect standing above him.\n\n \"Ford!",
    "Hello, how are you? \"\n\n\"Fine\" said Ford, \"look, are you busy? \"\n\n\"Am I busy? \" exclaimed Arthur.  \"Well, I've just got all these\nbulldozers and things to lie in front of because they'll knock my\nhouse down if I don't, but other than that...",
    "well, no not\nespecially, why? \"\n\nThey don't have sarcasm on Betelgeuse, and Ford Prefect often\nfailed to notice it unless he was concentrating.  He said, \"Good,\nis there anywhere we can talk? \"\n\n\"What? \" said Arthur Dent.",
    "For a few seconds Ford seemed to ignore him, and stared fixedly\ninto the sky like a rabbit trying to get run over by a car.  Then\nsuddenly he squatted down beside Arthur.\n\n \"We've got to talk\" he said urgently.\n\n \"Fine\" said Arthur, \"talk\"\n\n\"And drink\" said Ford.",
    "\"It's vitally important that we talk and\ndrink.  Now.  We'll go to the pub in the village\"\n\nHe looked into the sky again, nervous, expectant.\n\n \"Look, don't you understand? \" shouted Arthur.  He pointed at\nProsser.  \"That man wants to knock my house down! \"\n\nFord glanced at him, puzzled.",
    "\"Well he can do it while you're away can't he? \" he asked.\n\n \"But I don't want him to! \"\n\n\"Ah\"\n\n\"Look, what's the matter with you Ford? \" said Arthur.\n\n \"Nothing.  Nothing's the matter.  Listen to me I've got to tell\nyou the most important thing you've ever heard.",
    "I've got to tell\nyou now, and I've got to tell you in the saloon bar of the Horse\nand Groom\"\n\n\"But why?",
    "\"\n\n\"Because you are going to need a very stiff drink\"\n\nFord stared at Arthur, and Arthur was astonished to find that his\nwill was beginning to weaken.",
    "He didn't realize that this was\nbecause of an old drinking game that Ford learned to play in the\nhyperspace ports that served the madranite mining belts in the\nstar system of Orion Beta.",
    "The game was not unlike the Earth game called Indian Wrestling,\nand was played like this:\n\nTwo contestants would sit either side of a table, with a glass in\nfront of each of them.",
    "Between them would be placed a bottle of Janx Spirit (as\nimmortalized in that ancient Orion mining song \"Oh don't give me\nnone more of that Old Janx Spirit/ No, don't you give me none\nmore of that Old Janx Spirit/ For my head will fly, my tongue\nwill lie, my eyes will fry and I may die/ Won't you pour me one\nmore of that sinful Old Janx Spirit\").",
    "Each of the two contestants would then concentrate their will on\nthe bottle and attempt to tip it and pour spirit into the glass\nof his opponent who would then have to drink it.\n\n The bottle would then be refilled.  The game would be played\nagain.  And again.",
    "Once you started to lose you would probably keep losing, because\none of the effects of Janx spirit is to depress telepsychic\npower.\n\n As soon as a predetermined quantity had been consumed, the final\nloser would have to perform a forfeit, which was usually\nobscenely biological.",
    "Ford Prefect usually played to lose.\n\n Ford stared at Arthur, who began to think that perhaps he did\nwant to go to the Horse and Groom after all.\n\n \"But what about my house...? \" he asked plaintively.\n\n Ford looked across to Mr Prosser, and suddenly a wicked thought\nstruck him.",
    "\"He wants to knock your house down? \"\n\n\"Yes, he wants to build.. \"\n\n\"And he can't because you're lying in front of the bulldozers? \"\n\n\"Yes, and.. \"\n\n\"I'm sure we can come to some arrangement\" said Ford.  \"Excuse\nme! \" he shouted.",
    "Mr Prosser (who was arguing with a spokesman for the bulldozer\ndrivers about whether or not Arthur Dent constituted a mental\nhealth hazard, and how much they should get paid if he did)\nlooked around.  He was surprised and slightly alarmed to find that\nArthur had company.\n\n \"Yes?  Hello?",
    "\" he called.  \"Has Mr Dent come to his senses yet? \"\n\n\"Can we for the moment\" called Ford, \"assume that he hasn't? \"\n\"Well? \" sighed Mr Prosser.\n\n \"And can we also assume\" said Ford, \"that he's going to be\nstaying here all day? \"\n\n\"So?",
    "\"\n\n\"So all your men are going to be standing around all day doing\nnothing? \"\n\n\"Could be, could be.. \"\n\n\"Well, if you're resigned to doing that anyway, you don't\nactually need him to lie here all the time do you? \"\n\n\"What?",
    "\"\n\n\"You don't\" said Ford patiently, \"actually need him here\"\n\nMr Prosser thought about this.\n\n \"Well no, not as such.. \", he said, \"not exactly need.. \"\nProsser was worried.  He thought that one of them wasn't making a\nlot of sense.",
    "Ford said, \"So if you would just like to take it as read that\nhe's actually here, then he and I could slip off down to the pub\nfor half an hour.  How does that sound? \"\n\nMr Prosser thought it sounded perfectly potty.",
    "\"That sounds perfectly reasonable\" he said in a reassuring tone\nof voice, wondering who he was trying to reassure.",
    "\"And if you want to pop off for a quick one yourself later on\"\nsaid Ford, \"we can always cover up for you in return\"\n\n\"Thank you very much\" said Mr Prosser who no longer knew how to\nplay this at all, \"thank you very much, yes, that's very kind..",
    "\" He frowned, then smiled, then tried to do both at once,\nfailed, grasped hold of his fur hat and rolled it fitfully round\nthe top of his head.  He could only assume that he had just won.",
    "\"So\" continued Ford Prefect, \"if you would just like to come\nover here and lie down.. \"\n\n\"What? \" said Mr Prosser.\n\n \"Ah, I'm sorry\" said Ford, \"perhaps I hadn't made myself fully\nclear.  Somebody's got to lie in front of the bulldozers haven't\nthey?",
    "Or there won't be anything to stop them driving into Mr\nDent's house will there? \"\n\n\"What? \" said Mr Prosser again.",
    "\"It's very simple\" said Ford, \"my client, Mr Dent, says that he\nwill stop lying here in the mud on the sole condition that you\ncome and take over from him\"\n\"What are you talking about? \" said Arthur, but Ford nudged him\nwith his shoe to be quiet.",
    "\"You want me\" said Mr Prosser, spelling out this new thought to\nhimself, \"to come and lie there.. \"\n\n\"Yes\"\n\n\"In front of the bulldozer?",
    "\"\n\n\"Yes\"\n\n\"Instead of Mr Dent\"\n\n\"Yes\"\n\n\"In the mud\"\n\n\"In, as you say it, the mud\"\n\nAs soon as Mr Prosser realized that he was substantially the\nloser after all, it was as if a weight lifted itself off his\nshoulders: this was more like the world as he knew it.",
    "He sighed.\n\n \"In return for which you will take Mr Dent with you down to the\npub? \"\n\n\"That's it\" said Ford.  \"That's it exactly\"\n\nMr Prosser took a few nervous steps forward and stopped.\n\n \"Promise? \"\n\n\"Promise\" said Ford.  He turned to Arthur.",
    "\"Come on\" he said to him, \"get up and let the man lie down\"\n\nArthur stood up, feeling as if he was in a dream.\n\n Ford beckoned to Prosser who sadly, awkwardly, sat down in the\nmud.",
    "He felt that his whole life was some kind of dream and he\nsometimes wondered whose it was and whether they were enjoying\nit.  The mud folded itself round his bottom and his arms and oozed\ninto his shoes.\n\n Ford looked at him severely.",
    "\"And no sneaky knocking down Mr Dent's house whilst he's away,\nalright? \" he said.",
    "\"The mere thought\" growled Mr Prosser, \"hadn't even begun to\nspeculate\" he continued, settling himself back, \"about the\nmerest possibility of crossing my mind\"\n\nHe saw the bulldozer driver's union representative approaching\nand let his head sink back and closed his eyes.",
    "He was trying to\nmarshal his arguments for proving that he did not now constitute\na mental health hazard himself.  He was far from certain about\nthis his mind seemed to be full of noise, horses, smoke, and\nthe stench of blood.",
    "This always happened when he felt miserable\nand put upon, and he had never been able to explain it to\nhimself.  In a high dimension of which we know nothing the mighty\nKhan bellowed with rage, but Mr Prosser only trembled slightly\nand whimpered.",
    "He began to fell little pricks of water behind the\neyelids.  Bureaucratic cock ups, angry men lying in the mud,\nindecipherable strangers handing out inexplicable humiliations\nand an unidentified army of horsemen laughing at him in his head\n what a day.\n\n What a day.",
    "Ford Prefect knew that it didn't matter a pair of\ndingo's kidneys whether Arthur's house got knocked down or not\nnow.\n\n Arthur remained very worried.\n\n \"But can we trust him? \" he said.\n\n \"Myself I'd trust him to the end of the Earth\" said Ford.",
    "\"Oh yes\" said Arthur, \"and how far's that? \"\n\n\"About twelve minutes away\" said Ford, \"come on, I need a\ndrink\"\n\n\n\n\nHere's what the Encyclopedia Galactica has to say about alcohol.",

    "\"Er, about five years, maybe six\" he\nsaid.  \"Most of it seemed to make some sense at the time\"\n\n\"Alright\" said Ford.  \"How would you react if I said that I'm not\nfrom Guildford after all, but from a small planet somewhere in\nthe vicinity of Betelgeuse?",
    "\"\nArthur shrugged in a so so sort of way.\n\n \"I don't know\" he said, taking a pull of beer.  \"Why do you\nthink it's the sort of thing you're likely to say? \"\n\nFord gave up.",
    "It really wasn't worth bothering at the moment,\nwhat with the world being about to end.  He just said:\n\n\"Drink up\"\n\nHe added, perfectly factually:\n\n\"The world's about to end\"\n\nArthur gave the rest of the pub another wan smile.  The rest of\nthe pub frowned at him.",
    "A man waved at him to stop smiling at\nthem and mind his own business.",
    "\"This must be Thursday\" said Arthur musing to himself, sinking\nlow over his beer, \"I never could get the hang of Thursdays\"\n\n\n\n\nOn this particular Thursday, something was moving quietly through\nthe ionosphere many miles above the surface of the planet;\nseveral somethings in fact, several dozen huge yellow chunky\nslablike somethings, huge as office buildings, silent as birds.",
    "They soared with ease, basking in electromagnetic rays from the\nstar Sol, biding their time, grouping, preparing.\n\n The planet beneath them was almost perfectly oblivious of their\npresence, which was just how they wanted it for the moment.",
    "The\nhuge yellow somethings went unnoticed at Goonhilly, they passed\nover Cape Canaveral without a blip, Woomera and Jodrell Bank\nlooked straight through them which was a pity because it was\nexactly the sort of thing they'd been looking for all these\nyears.",
    "The only place they registered at all was on a small black device\ncalled a Sub Etha Sens O Matic which winked away quietly to\nitself.  It nestled in the darkness inside a leather satchel which\nFord Prefect wore habitually round his neck.",
    "The contents of Ford\nPrefect's satchel were quite interesting in fact and would have\nmade any Earth physicist's eyes pop out of his head, which is why\nhe always concealed them by keeping a couple of dog eared scripts\nfor plays he pretended he was auditioning for stuffed in the top.",
    "Besides the Sub Etha Sens O Matic and the scripts he had an\nElectronic Thumb a short squat black rod, smooth and matt with\na couple of flat switches and dials at one end; he also had a\ndevice which looked rather like a largish electronic calculator.",
    "This had about a hundred tiny flat press buttons and a screen\nabout four inches square on which any one of a million \"pages\"\ncould be summoned at a moment's notice.",
    "It looked insanely\ncomplicated, and this was one of the reasons why the snug plastic\ncover it fitted into had the words Don't Panic printed on it in\nlarge friendly letters.",
    "The other reason was that this device was\nin fact that most remarkable of all books ever to come out of the\ngreat publishing corporations of Ursa Minor The Hitch Hiker's\nGuide to the Galaxy.",
    "The reason why it was published in the form\nof a micro sub meson electronic component is that if it were\nprinted in normal book form, an interstellar hitch hiker would\nrequire several inconveniently large buildings to carry it around\nin.",
    "Beneath that in Ford Prefect's satchel were a few biros, a\nnotepad, and a largish bath towel from Marks and Spencer.\n\n The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy has a few things to say on\nthe subject of towels.",
    "A towel, it says, is about the most massively useful thing an\ninterstellar hitch hiker can have.",
    "Partly it has great practical\nvalue you can wrap it around you for warmth as you bound across\nthe cold moons of Jaglan Beta; you can lie on it on the brilliant\nmarble sanded beaches of Santraginus V, inhaling the heady sea\nvapours; you can sleep under it beneath the stars which shine so\nredly on the desert world of Kakrafoon; use it to sail a mini\nraft down the slow heavy river Moth; wet it for use in hand to \nhand combat; wrap it round your head to ward off noxious fumes or\nto avoid the gaze of the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal (a\nmindboggingly stupid animal, it assumes that if you can't see it,\nit can't see you daft as a bush, but very ravenous); you can\nwave your towel in emergencies as a distress signal, and of\ncourse dry yourself off with it if it still seems to be clean\nenough.",
    "More importantly, a towel has immense psychological value.",
    "For\nsome reason, if a strag (strag: non hitch hiker) discovers that a\nhitch hiker has his towel with him, he will automatically assume\nthat he is also in possession of a toothbrush, face flannel,\nsoap, tin of biscuits, flask, compass, map, ball of string, gnat\nspray, wet weather gear, space suit etc.",
    ", etc.  Furthermore, the\nstrag will then happily lend the hitch hiker any of these or a\ndozen other items that the hitch hiker might accidentally have\n\"lost\".",
    "What the strag will think is that any man who can hitch\nthe length and breadth of the galaxy, rough it, slum it, struggle\nagainst terrible odds, win through, and still knows where his\ntowel is is clearly a man to be reckoned with.",
    "Hence a phrase which has passed into hitch hiking slang, as in\n\"Hey, you sass that hoopy Ford Prefect?  There's a frood who\nreally knows where his towel is\" (Sass: know, be aware of, meet,\nhave sex with; hoopy: really together guy; frood: really\namazingly together guy.",
    ")\n\nNestling quietly on top of the towel in Ford Prefect's satchel,\nthe Sub Etha Sens O Matic began to wink more quickly.  Miles above\nthe surface of the planet the huge yellow somethings began to fan\nout.",
    "At Jodrell Bank, someone decided it was time for a nice\nrelaxing cup of tea.\n\n \"You got a towel with you? \" said Ford Prefect suddenly to Arthur.\n\n Arthur, struggling through his third pint, looked round at him.\n\n \"Why?  What, no...  should I have?",
    "\" He had given up being\nsurprised, there didn't seem to be any point any longer.\n\n Ford clicked his tongue in irritation.\n\n \"Drink up\" he urged.",
    "At that moment the dull sound of a rumbling crash from outside\nfiltered through the low murmur of the pub, through the sound of\nthe jukebox, through the sound of the man next to Ford hiccupping\nover the whisky Ford had eventually bought him.",
    "Arthur choked on his beer, leapt to his feet.\n\n \"What's that? \" he yelped.\n\n \"Don't worry\" said Ford, \"they haven't started yet\"\n\n\"Thank God for that\" said Arthur and relaxed.\n\n \"It's probably just your house being knocked down\" said Ford,\ndrowning his last pint.\n\n \"What? \" shouted Arthur.",
    "Suddenly Ford's spell was broken.  Arthur\nlooked wildly around him and ran to the window.\n\n \"My God they are!  They're knocking my house down.  What the hell\nam I doing in the pub, Ford?",
    "\"\n\n\"It hardly makes any difference at this stage\" said Ford, \"let\nthem have their fun\"\n\n\"Fun? \" yelped Arthur.  \"Fun! \" He quickly checked out of the window\nagain that they were talking about the same thing.\n\n \"Damn their fun!",
    "\" he hooted and ran out of the pub furiously\nwaving a nearly empty beer glass.  He made no friends at all in\nthe pub that lunchtime.\n\n \"Stop, you vandals!  You home wreckers! \" bawled Arthur.  \"You half\ncrazed Visigoths, stop will you!",
    "\"\n\nFord would have to go after him.  Turning quickly to the barman he\nasked for four packets of peanuts.",
    "\"There you are sir\" said the barman, slapping the packets on the\nbar, \"twenty eight pence if you'd be so kind\"\n\nFord was very kind he gave the barman another five pound note\nand told him to keep the change.  The barman looked at it and then\nlooked at Ford.",
    "He suddenly shivered: he experienced a momentary\nsensation that he didn't understand because no one on Earth had\never experienced it before.  In moments of great stress, every\nlife form that exists gives out a tiny sublimal signal.",
    "This\nsignal simply communicates an exact and almost pathetic sense of\nhow far that being is from the place of his birth.",
    "On Earth it is\nnever possible to be further than sixteen thousand miles from\nyour birthplace, which really isn't very far, so such signals are\ntoo minute to be noticed.",
    "Ford Prefect was at this moment under\ngreat stress, and he was born 600 light years away in the near\nvicinity of Betelgeuse.\n\n The barman reeled for a moment, hit by a shocking,\nincomprehensible sense of distance.",
    "He didn't know what it meant,\nbut he looked at Ford Prefect with a new sense of respect, almost\nawe.\n\n \"Are you serious, sir? \" he said in a small whisper which had the\neffect of silencing the pub.  \"You think the world's going to\nend? \"\n\n\"Yes\" said Ford.",
    "\"But, this afternoon? \"\n\nFord had recovered himself.  He was at his flippest.\n\n \"Yes\" he said gaily, \"in less than two minutes I would\nestimate\"\n\nThe barman couldn't believe the conversation he was having, but\nhe couldn't believe the sensation he had just had either.",
    "\"Isn't there anything we can do about it then? \" he said.\n\n \"No, nothing\" said Ford, stuffing the peanuts into his pockets.\n\n Someone in the hushed bar suddenly laughed raucously at how\nstupid everyone had become.\n\n The man sitting next to Ford was a bit sozzled by now.",
    "His eyes\nwaved their way up to Ford.\n\n \"I thought\" he said, \"that if the world was going to end we were\nmeant to lie down or put a paper bag over our head or something\"\n\n\"If you like, yes\" said Ford.",
    "\"That's what they told us in the army\" said the man, and his\neyes began the long trek back down to his whisky.\n\n \"Will that help? \" asked the barman.\n\n \"No\" said Ford and gave him a friendly smile.",
    "\"Excuse me\" he\nsaid, \"I've got to go\" With a wave, he left.\n\n The pub was silent for a moment longer, and then, embarrassingly\nenough, the man with the raucous laugh did it again.",
    "The girl he\nhad dragged along to the pub with him had grown to loathe him\ndearly over the last hour or so, and it would probably have been\na great satisfaction to her to know that in a minute and a half\nor so he would suddenly evaporate into a whiff of hydrogen, ozone\nand carbon monoxide.",
    "However, when the moment came she would be\ntoo busy evaporating herself to notice it.\n\n The barman cleared his throat.  He heard himself say:\n\n\"Last orders, please\"\nThe huge yellow machines began to sink downward and to move\nfaster.\n\n Ford knew they were there.",
    "This wasn't the way he had wanted it.\n\n Running up the lane, Arthur had nearly reached his house.  He\ndidn't notice how cold it had suddenly become, he didn't notice\nthe wind, he didn't notice the sudden irrational squall of rain.",
    "He didn't notice anything but the caterpillar bulldozers crawling\nover the rubble that had been his home.\n\n \"You barbarians! \" he yelled.  \"I'll sue the council for every\npenny it's got!  I'll have you hung, drawn and quartered!  And\nwhipped!  And boiled...  until...  until...",
    "until you've had\nenough\"\n\nFord was running after him very fast.  Very very fast.\n\n \"And then I'll do it again! \" yelled Arthur.  \"And when I've\nfinished I will take all the little bits, and I will jump on\nthem!",
    "\"\n\nArthur didn't notice that the men were running from the\nbulldozers; he didn't notice that Mr Prosser was staring\nhectically into the sky.  What Mr Prosser had noticed was that\nhuge yellow somethings were screaming through the clouds.\n Impossibly huge yellow somethings.",
    "\"And I will carry on jumping on them\" yelled Arthur, still\nrunning, \"until I get blisters, or I can think of anything even\nmore unpleasant to do, and then.. \"\n\nArthur tripped, and fell headlong, rolled and landed flat on his\nback.",
    "At last he noticed that something was going on.  His finger\nshot upwards.\n\n \"What the hell's that? \" he shrieked.",
    "Whatever it was raced across the sky in monstrous yellowness,\ntore the sky apart with mind buggering noise and leapt off into\nthe distance leaving the gaping air to shut behind it with a bang\nthat drove your ears six feet into your skull.",
    "Another one followed and did the same thing only louder.\n\n It's difficult to say exactly what the people on the surface of\nthe planet were doing now, because they didn't really know what\nthey were doing themselves.",
    "None of it made a lot of sense \nrunning into houses, running out of houses, howling noiselessly\nat the noise.",
    "All around the world city streets exploded with\npeople, cars slewed into each other as the noise fell on them and\nthen rolled off like a tidal wave over hills and valleys, deserts\nand oceans, seeming to flatten everything it hit.",
    "Only one man stood and watched the sky, stood with terrible\nsadness in his eyes and rubber bungs in his ears.",
    "He knew exactly\nwhat was happening and had known ever since his Sub Etha Sens O \nMatic had started winking in the dead of night beside his pillar\nand woken him with a start.",
    "It was what he had waited for all\nthese years, but when he had deciphered the signal pattern\nsitting alone in his small dark room a coldness had gripped him\nand squeezed his heart.",
    "Of all the races in all of the Galaxy who\ncould have come and said a big hello to planet Earth, he thought,\ndidn't it just have to be the Vogons.\n\n Still he knew what he had to do.",
    "As the Vogon craft screamed\nthrough the air high above him he opened his satchel.  He threw\naway a copy of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, he\nthrew away a copy of Godspell: He wouldn't need them where he was\ngoing.  Everything was ready, everything was prepared.",
    "He knew where his towel was.\n\n A sudden silence hit the Earth.  If anything it was worse than the\nnoise.  For a while nothing happened.\n\n The great ships hung motionless in the air, over every nation on\nEarth.",
    "Motionless they hung, huge, heavy, steady in the sky, a\nblasphemy against nature.  Many people went straight into shock as\ntheir minds tried to encompass what they were looking at.  The\nships hung in the sky in much the same way that bricks don't.\n\n And still nothing happened.",
    "Then there was a slight whisper, a sudden spacious whisper of\nopen ambient sound.  Every hi fi set in the world, every radio,\nevery television, every cassette recorder, every woofer, every\ntweeter, every mid range driver in the world quietly turned\nitself on.",
    "Every tin can, every dust bin, every window, every car, every\nwine glass, every sheet of rusty metal became activated as an\nacoustically perfect sounding board.",
    "Before the Earth passed away it was going to be treated to the\nvery ultimate in sound reproduction, the greatest public address\nsystem ever built.  But there was no concert, no music, no\nfanfare, just a simple message.",
    "\"People of Earth, your attention please\" a voice said, and it\nwas wonderful.  Wonderful perfect quadrophonic sound with\ndistortion levels so low as to make a brave man weep.\n\n \"This is Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz of the Galactic Hyperspace\nPlanning Council\" the voice continued.",
    "\"As you will no doubt be\naware, the plans for development of the outlying regions of the\nGalaxy require the building of a hyperspatial express route\nthrough your star system, and regrettably your planet is one of\nthose scheduled for demolition.",
    "The process will take slightly\nless that two of your Earth minutes.  Thank you\"\n\nThe PA died away.\n\n Uncomprehending terror settled on the watching people of Earth.",
    "The terror moved slowly through the gathered crowds as if they\nwere iron fillings on a sheet of board and a magnet was moving\nbeneath them.  Panic sprouted again, desperate fleeing panic, but\nthere was nowhere to flee to.\n Observing this, the Vogons turned on their PA again.",
    "It said:\n\n\"There's no point in acting all surprised about it.",
    "All the\nplanning charts and demolition orders have been on display in\nyour local planning department on Alpha Centauri for fifty of\nyour Earth years, so you've had plenty of time to lodge any\nformal complaint and it's far too late to start making a fuss\nabout it now\"\n\nThe PA fell silent again and its echo drifted off across the\nland.",
    "The huge ships turned slowly in the sky with easy power.  On\nthe underside of each a hatchway opened, an empty black space.",
    "By this time somebody somewhere must have manned a radio\ntransmitter, located a wavelength and broadcasted a message back\nto the Vogon ships, to plead on behalf of the planet.  Nobody ever\nheard what they said, they only heard the reply.  The PA slammed\nback into life again.",
    "The voice was annoyed.  It said:\n\n\"What do you mean you've never been to Alpha Centauri?  For\nheaven's sake mankind, it's only four light years away you know.\n I'm sorry, but if you can't be bothered to take an interest in\nlocal affairs that's your own lookout.",
    "\"Energize the demolition beams\"\n\nLight poured out into the hatchways.\n\n \"I don't know\" said the voice on the PA, \"apathetic bloody\nplanet, I've no sympathy at all\" It cut off.\n\n There was a terrible ghastly silence.\n\n There was a terrible ghastly noise.\n\n There was a terrible ghastly silence.",
    "The Vogon Constructor fleet coasted away into the inky starry\nvoid.",
    "Far away on the opposite spiral arm of the Galaxy, five hundred\nthousand light years from the star Sol, Zaphod Beeblebrox,\nPresident of the Imperial Galactic Government, sped across the\nseas of Damogran, his ion drive delta boat winking and flashing\nin the Damogran sun.",
    "Damogran the hot; Damogran the remote; Damogran the almost\ntotally unheard of.\n\n Damogran, secret home of the Heart of Gold.\n\n The boat sped on across the water.  It would be some time before\nit reached its destination because Damogran is such an\ninconveniently arranged planet.",
    "It consists of nothing but\nmiddling to large desert islands separated by very pretty but\nannoyingly wide stretches of ocean.\n\n The boat sped on.\n\n Because of this topological awkwardness Damogran has always\nremained a deserted planet.",
    "This is why the Imperial Galactic\nGovernment chose Damogran for the Heart of Gold project, because\nit was so deserted and the Heart of Gold was so secret.",
    "The boat zipped and skipped across the sea, the sea that lay\nbetween the main islands of the only archipelago of any useful\nsize on the whole planet.",
    "Zaphod Beeblebrox was on his way from\nthe tiny spaceport on Easter Island (the name was an entirely\nmeaningless coincidence in Galacticspeke, easter means small\nflat and light brown) to the Heart of Gold island, which by\nanother meaningless coincidence was called France.",
    "One of the side effects of work on the Heart of Gold was a whole\nstring of pretty meaningless coincidences.",
    "But it was not in any way a coincidence that today, the day of\nculmination of the project, the great day of unveiling, the day\nthat the Heart of Gold was finally to be introduced to a\nmarvelling Galaxy, was also a great day of culmination for Zaphod\nBeeblebrox.",
    "It was for the sake of this day that he had first\ndecided to run for the Presidency, a decision which had sent\nwaves of astonishment throughout the Imperial Galaxy Zaphod\nBeeblebrox?  President?  Not the Zaphod Beeblebrox?  Not the\nPresident?",
    "Many had seen it as a clinching proof that the whole\nof known creation had finally gone bananas.\n\n Zaphod grinned and gave the boat an extra kick of speed.\n\n Zaphod Beeblebrox, adventurer, ex hippy, good timer, (crook?",
    "quite possibly), manic self publicist, terribly bad at personal\nrelationships, often thought to be completely out to lunch.\n\n President?\n\n No one had gone bananas, not in that way at least.",
    "Only six people in the entire Galaxy understood the principle on\nwhich the Galaxy was governed, and they knew that once Zaphod\nBeeblebrox had announced his intention to run as President it was\nmore or less a fait accompli: he was the ideal Presidency\nfodder*.",
    "What they completely failed to understand was why Zaphod was\ndoing it.\n\n He banked sharply, shooting a wild wall of water at the sun.\n\n Today was the day; today was the day when they would realize what\nZaphod had been up to.",
    "Today was what Zaphod Beeblebrox's\nPresidency was all about.  Today was also his two hundredth\nbirthday, but that was just another meaningless coincidence.\n\n As he skipped his boat across the seas of Damogran he smiled\nquietly to himself about what a wonderful exciting day it was\ngoing to be.",
    "He relaxed and spread his two arms lazily across the\nseat back.  He steered with an extra arm he'd recently fitted just\nbeneath his right one to help improve his ski boxing.",
    "\"Hey\" he cooed to himself, \"you're a real cool boy you\" But his\nnerves sang a song shriller than a dog whistle.\n\n The island of France was about twenty miles long, five miles\nacross the middle, sandy and crescent shaped.",
    "In fact it seemed\nto exist not so much as an island in its own right as simply a\nmeans of defining the sweep and curve of a huge bay.  This\nimpression was heightened by the fact that the inner coastline of\nthe crescent consisted almost entirely of steep cliffs.",
    "From the\ntop of the cliff the land sloped slowly down five miles to the\nopposite shore.\n\n On top of the cliffs stood a reception committee.",
    "It consisted in large part of the engineers and researchers who\nhad built the Heart of Gold mostly humanoid, but here and there\nwere a few reptiloid atomineers, two or three green slyph like\nmaximegalacticans, an octopoid physucturalist or two and a\nHooloovoo (a Hooloovoo is a super intelligent shade of the color\nblue).",
    "All except the Hooloovoo were resplendent in their multi \ncolored ceremonial lab coats; the Hooloovoo had been temporarily\nrefracted into a free standing prism for the occasion.\n\n There was a mood of immense excitement thrilling through all of\nthem.",
    "Together and between them they had gone to and beyond the\nfurthest limits of physical laws, restructured the fundamental\nfabric of matter, strained, twisted and broken the laws of\npossibility and impossibility, but still the greatest excitement\nof all seemed to be to meet a man with an orange sash round his\nneck.",
    "(An orange sash was what the President of the Galaxy\ntraditionally wore. ) It might not even have made much difference\nto them if they'd known exactly how much power the President of\nthe Galaxy actually wielded: none at all.",
    "Only six people in the\nGalaxy knew that the job of the Galactic President was not to\nwield power but to attract attention away from it.\n\n Zaphod Beeblebrox was amazingly good at his job.",
    "The crowd gasped, dazzled by sun and seemanship, as the\nPresidential speedboat zipped round the headland into the bay.  It\nflashed and shone as it came skating over the sea in wide\nskidding turns.",
    "In fact it didn't need to touch the water at all, because it was\nsupported on a hazy cushion of ionized atoms but just for\neffect it was fitted with thin finblades which could be lowered\ninto the water.",
    "They slashed sheets of water hissing into the\nair, carved deep gashes into the sea which swayed crazily and\nsank back foaming into the boat's wake as it careered across the\nbay.\n\n Zaphod loved effect: it was what he was best at.",
    "He twisted the wheel sharply, the boat slewed round in a wild\nscything skid beneath the cliff face and dropped to rest lightly\non the rocking waves.\n\n Within seconds he ran out onto the deck and waved and grinned at\nover three billion people.",
    "The three billion people weren't\nactually there, but they watched his every gesture through the\neyes of a small robot tri D camera which hovered obsequiously in\nthe air nearby.  The antics of the President always made amazingly\npopular tri D; that's what they were for.\n\n He grinned again.",
    "Three billion and six people didn't know it,\nbut today would be a bigger antic than anyone had bargained for.\n\n The robot camera homed in for a close up on the more popular of\nhis two heads and he waved again.",
    "He was roughly humanoid in\nappearance except for the extra head and third arm.  His fair\ntousled hair stuck out in random directions, his blue eyes\nglinted with something completely unidentifiable, and his chins\nwere almost always unshaven.",
    "A twenty foot high transparent globe floated next to his boat,\nrolling and bobbing, glistening in the brilliant sun.",
    "Inside it\nfloated a wide semi circular sofa upholstered in glorious red\nleather: the more the globe bobbed and rolled, the more the sofa\nstayed perfectly still, steady as an upholstered rock.  Again, all\ndone for effect as much as anything.",
    "Zaphod stepped through the wall of the globe and relaxed on the\nsofa.  He spread his two arms lazily along the back and with the\nthird brushed some dust off his knee.  His heads looked about,\nsmiling; he put his feet up.  At any moment, he thought, he might\nscream.",
    "Water boiled up beneath the bubble, it seethed and spouted.  The\nbubble surged into the air, bobbing and rolling on the water\nspout.  Up, up it climbed, throwing stilts of light at the cliff.",
    "Up it surged on the jet, the water falling from beneath it,\ncrashing back into the sea hundreds of feet below.\n\n Zaphod smiled, picturing himself.\n\n A thoroughly ridiculous form of transport, but a thoroughly\nbeautiful one.",
    "At the top of the cliff the globe wavered for a moment, tipped on\nto a railed ramp, rolled down it to a small concave platform and\nriddled to a halt.\n\n To tremendous applause Zaphod Beeblebrox stepped out of the\nbubble, his orange sash blazing in the light.",
    "The President of the Galaxy had arrived.\n\n He waited for the applause to die down, then raised his hands in\ngreeting.\n\n \"Hi\" he said.\n\n A government spider sidled up to him and attempted to press a\ncopy of his prepared speech into his hands.",
    "Pages three to seven\nof the original version were at the moment floating soggily on\nthe Damogran sea some five miles out from the bay.",
    "Pages one and\ntwo had been salvaged by a Damogran Frond Crested Eagle and had\nalready become incorporated into an extraordinary new form of\nnest which the eagle had invented.",
    "It was constructed largely of\npapier m@ch@ and it was virtually impossible for a newly hatched\nbaby eagle to break out of it.  The Damogran Frond Crested Eagle\nhad heard of the notion of survival of the species but wanted no\ntruck with it.",
    "Zaphod Beeblebrox would not be needing his set speech and he\ngently deflected the one being offered him by the spider.\n\n \"Hi\" he said again.\n\n Everyone beamed at him, or, at least, nearly everyone.  He singled\nout Trillian from the crowd.",
    "Trillian was a gird that Zaphod had\npicked up recently whilst visiting a planet, just for fun,\nincognito.  She was slim, darkish, humanoid, with long waves of\nblack hair, a full mouth, an odd little nob of a nose and\nridiculously brown eyes.",
    "With her red head scarf knotted in that\nparticular way and her long flowing silky brown dress she looked\nvaguely Arabic.  Not that anyone there had ever heard of an Arab\nof course.",
    "The Arabs had very recently ceased to exist, and even\nwhen they had existed they were five hundred thousand light years\nfrom Damogran.  Trillian wasn't anybody in particular, or so\nZaphod claimed.  She just went around with him rather a lot and\ntold him what she thought of him.",
    "\"Hi honey\" he said to her.\n\n She flashed him a quick tight smile and looked away.  Then she\nlooked back for a moment and smiled more warmly but by this\ntime he was looking at something else.",
    "\"Hi\" he said to a small knot of creatures from the press who\nwere standing nearby wishing that he would stop saying Hi and get\non with the quotes.",
    "He grinned at them particularly because he\nknew that in a few moments he would be giving them one hell of a\nquote.\n\n The next thing he said though was not a lot of use to them.",
    "One\nof the officials of the party had irritably decided that the\nPresident was clearly not in a mood to read the deliciously\nturned speech that had been written for him, and had flipped the\nswitch on the remote control device in his pocket.",
    "Away in front\nof them a huge white dome that bulged against the sky cracked\ndown in the middle, split, and slowly folded itself down into the\nground.  Everyone gasped although they had known perfectly well it\nwas going to do that because they had built it that way.",
    "Beneath it lay uncovered a huge starship, one hundred and fifty\nmetres long, shaped like a sleek running shoe, perfectly white\nand mindboggingly beautiful.",
    "At the heart of it, unseen, lay a\nsmall gold box which carried within it the most brain wretching\ndevice ever conceived, a device which made this starship unique\nin the history of the galaxy, a device after which the ship had\nbeen named The Heart of Gold.",
    "\"Wow\", said Zaphod Beeblebrox to the Heart of Gold.  There wasn't\nmuch else he could say.\n\n He said it again because he knew it would annoy the press.\n\n \"Wow\"\n\nThe crowd turned their faces back towards him expectantly.",
    "He\nwinked at Trillian who raised her eyebrows and widened her eyes\nat him.  She knew what he was about to say and thought him a\nterrible showoff.\n\n \"That is really amazing\" he said.  \"That really is truly amazing.",
    "That is so amazingly amazing I think I'd like to steal it\"\n\nA marvellous Presidential quote, absolutely true to form.  The\ncrowd laughed appreciatively, the newsmen gleefully punched\nbuttons on their Sub Etha News Matics and the President grinned.",
    "As he grinned his heart screamed unbearably and he fingered the\nsmall Paralyso Matic bomb that nestled quietly in his pocket.\n\n Finally he could bear it no more.",
    "He lifted his heads up to the\nsky, let out a wild whoop in major thirds, threw the bomb to the\nground and ran forward through the sea of suddenly frozen smiles.\n\n\n\n\n Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz was not a pleasant sight, even for other\nVogons.",
    "His highly domed nose rose high above a small piggy\nforehead.",
    "His dark green rubbery skin was thick enough for him to\nplay the game of Vogon Civil Service politics, and play it well,\nand waterproof enough for him to survive indefinitely at sea\ndepths of up to a thousand feet with no ill effects.",
    "Not that he ever went swimming of course.  His busy schedule would\nnot allow it.",
    "He was the way he was because billions of years ago\nwhen the Vogons had first crawled out of the sluggish primeval\nseas of Vogsphere, and had lain panting and heaving on the\nplanet's virgin shores...",
    "when the first rays of the bright young\nVogsol sun had shone across them that morning, it was as if the\nforces of evolution ad simply given up on them there and then,\nhad turned aside in disgust and written them off as an ugly and\nunfortunate mistake.",
    "They never evolved again; they should never\nhave survived.\n\n The fact that they did is some kind of tribute to the thick \nwilled slug brained stubbornness of these creatures.  Evolution?\n they said to themselves, Who needs it?",
    ", and what nature refused\nto do for them they simply did without until such time as they\nwere able to rectify the grosser anatomical inconveniences with\nsurgery.\n\n Meanwhile, the natural forces on the planet Vogsphere had been\nworking overtime to make up for their earlier blunder.",
    "They\nbrought forth scintillating jewelled scuttling crabs, which the\nVogons ate, smashing their shells with iron mallets; tall\naspiring trees with breathtaking slenderness and colour which the\nVogons cut down and burned the crab meat with; elegant gazelle \nlike creatures with silken coats and dewy eyes which the Vogons\nwould catch and sit on.",
    "They were no use as transport because\ntheir backs would snap instantly, but the Vogons sat on them\nanyway.\n\n Thus the planet Vogsphere whiled away the unhappy millennia until\nthe Vogons suddenly discovered the principles of interstellar\ntravel.",
    "Within a few short Vog years every last Vogon had\nmigrated to the Megabrantis cluster, the political hub of the\nGalaxy and now formed the immensely powerful backbone of the\nGalactic Civil Service.",
    "They have attempted to acquire learning,\nthey have attempted to acquire style and social grace, but in\nmost respects the modern Vogon is little different from his\nprimitive forebears.",
    "Every year they import twenty seven thousand\nscintillating jewelled scuttling crabs from their native planet\nand while away a happy drunken night smashing them to bits with\niron mallets.\n\n Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz was a fairly typical Vogon in that he was\nthoroughly vile.  Also, he did not like hitch hikers.",
    "Somewhere in a small dark cabin buried deep in the intestines of\nProstetnic Vogon Jeltz's flagship, a small match flared\nnervously.  The owner of the match was not a Vogon, but he knew\nall about them and was right to be nervous.  His name was Ford\nPrefect*.",
    "He looked about the cabin but could see very little; strange\nmonstrous shadows loomed and leaped with the tiny flickering\nflame, but all was quiet.  He breathed a silent thank you to the\nDentrassis.",
    "The Dentrassis are an unruly tribe of gourmands, a\nwild but pleasant bunch whom the Vogons had recently taken to\nemploying as catering staff on their long haul fleets, on the\nstrict understanding that they keep themselves very much to\nthemselves.",
    "This suited the Dentrassis fine, because they loved Vogon money,\nwhich is one of the hardest currencies in space, but loathed the\nVogons themselves.  The only sort of Vogon a Dentrassi liked to\nsee was an annoyed Vogon.",
    "It was because of this tiny piece of information that Ford\nPrefect was not now a whiff of hydrogen, ozone and carbon\nmonoxide.\n\n He heard a slight groan.  By the light of the match he saw a heavy\nshape moving slightly on the floor.",
    "Quickly he shook the match\nout, reached in his pocket, found what he was looking for and\ntook it out.  He crouched on the floor.  The shape moved again.\n\n Ford Prefect said: \"I bought some peanuts\"\n\nArthur Dent moved, and groaned again, muttering incoherently.",
    "\"Here, have some\" urged Ford, shaking the packet again, \"if\nyou've never been through a matter transference beam before\nyou've probably lost some salt and protein.  The beer you had\nshould have cushioned your system a bit\"\n\"Whhhrrrr.. \" said Arthur Dent.  He opened his eyes.\n\n \"It's dark\" he said.",
    "\"Yes\" said Ford Prefect, \"it's dark\"\n\n\"No light\" said Arthur Dent.",
    "\"Dark, no light\"\n\nOne of the things Ford Prefect had always found hardest to\nunderstand about human beings was their habit of continually\nstating and repeating the obvious, as in It's a nice day, or\nYou're very tall, or Oh dear you seem to have fallen down a\nthirty foot well, are you alright?",
    "At first Ford had formed a\ntheory to account for this strange behaviour.  If human beings\ndon't keep exercising their lips, he thought, their mouths\nprobably seize up.  After a few months' consideration and\nobservation he abandoned this theory in favour of a new one.",
    "If\nthey don't keep on exercising their lips, he thought, their\nbrains start working.",
    "After a while he abandoned this one as well\nas being obstructively cynical and decided he quite liked human\nbeings after all, but he always remained desperately worried\nabout the terrible number of things they didn't know about.",
    "\"Yes\" he agreed with Arthur, \"no light\" He helped Arthur to\nsome peanuts.  \"How do you feel? \" he asked.\n\n \"Like a military academy\" said Arthur, \"bits of me keep on\npassing out\"\n\nFord stared at him blankly in the darkness.",
    "\"If I asked you where the hell we were\" said Arthur weakly,\n\"would I regret it? \"\n\nFord stood up.  \"We're safe\" he said.\n\n \"Oh good\" said Arthur.",
    "\"We're in a small galley cabin\" said Ford, \"in one of the\nspaceships of the Vogon Constructor Fleet\"\n\n\"Ah\" said Arthur, \"this is obviously some strange usage of the\nword safe that I wasn't previously aware of\"\n\nFord struck another match to help him search for a light switch.",
    "Monstrous shadows leaped and loomed again.  Arthur struggled to\nhis feet and hugged himself apprehensively.  Hideous alien shapes\nseemed to throng about him, the air was thick with musty smells\nwhich sidled into his lungs without identifying themselves, and a\nlow irritating hum kept his brain from focusing.",
    "\"How did we get here? \" he asked, shivering slightly.\n\n \"We hitched a lift\" said Ford.\n\n \"Excuse me? \" said Arthur.",
    "\"Are you trying to tell me that we just\nstuck out our thumbs and some green bug eyed monster stuck his\nhead out and said, Hi fellas, hop right in.  I can take you as far\nas the Basingstoke roundabout?",
    "\"\n\n\"Well\" said Ford, \"the Thumb's an electronic sub etha signalling\ndevice, the roundabout's at Barnard's Star six light years away,\nbut otherwise, that's more or less right\"\n\n\"And the bug eyed monster? \"\n\n\"Is green, yes\"\n\n\"Fine\" said Arthur, \"when can I get home?",
    "\"\n\n\"You can't\" said Ford Prefect, and found the light switch.\n\n \"Shade your eyes.. \" he said, and turned it on.\n\n Even Ford was surprised.\n\n \"Good grief\" said Arthur, \"is this really the interior of a\nflying saucer?",
    "\"\n\nProstetnic Vogon Jeltz heaved his unpleasant green body round the\ncontrol bridge.  He always felt vaguely irritable after\ndemolishing populated planets.  He wished that someone would come\nand tell him that it was all wrong so that he could shout at them\nand feel better.",
    "He flopped as heavily as he could on to his\ncontrol seat in the hope that it would break and give him\nsomething to be genuinely angry about, but it only gave a\ncomplaining sort of creak.\n\n \"Go away!",
    "\" he shouted at a young Vogon guard who entered the\nbridge at that moment.  The guard vanished immediately, feeling\nrather relieved.  He was glad it wouldn't now be him who delivered\nthe report they'd just received.",
    "The report was an official\nrelease which said that a wonderful new form of spaceship drive\nwas at this moment being unveiled at a government research base\non Damogran which would henceforth make all hyperspatial express\nroutes unnecessary.",
    "Another door slid open, but this time the Vogon captain didn't\nshout because it was the door from the galley quarters where the\nDentrassis prepared his meals.  A meal would be most welcome.\n\n A huge furry creature bounded through the door with his lunch\ntray.",
    "It was grinning like a maniac.\n\n Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz was delighted.  He knew that when a\nDentrassi looked that pleased with itself there was something\ngoing on somewhere on the ship that he could get very angry\nindeed about.\n\n Ford and Arthur stared about them.\n\n \"Well, what do you think?",
    "\" said Ford.\n\n \"It's a bit squalid, isn't it? \"\n\nFord frowned at the grubby mattress, unwashed cups and\nunidentifiable bits of smelly alien underwear that lay around the\ncramped cabin.\n\n \"Well, this is a working ship, you see\" said Ford.",
    "\"These are\nthe Dentrassi sleeping quarters\"\n\n\"I thought you said they were called Vogons or something\"\n\n\"Yes\" said Ford, \"the Vogons run the ship, the Dentrassis are\nthe cooks, they let us on board\"\n\n\"I'm confused\" said Arthur.\n\n \"Here, have a look at this\" said Ford.",
    "He sat down on one of the\nmattresses and rummaged about in his satchel.",
    "Arthur prodded the\nmattress nervously and then sat on it himself: in fact he had\nvery little to be nervous about, because all mattresses grown in\nthe swamps of Squornshellous Zeta are very thoroughly killed and\ndried before being put to service.  Very few have ever come to\nlife again.",
    "Ford handed the book to Arthur.\n\n \"What is it? \" asked Arthur.\n\n \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.  It's a sort of electronic\nbook.  It tells you everything you need to know about anything.\n That's its job\"\n\nArthur turned it over nervously in his hands.",
    "\"I like the cover\" he said.  \"Don't Panic.  It's the first helpful\nor intelligible thing anybody's said to me all day\"\n\n\"I'll show you how it works\" said Ford.",
    "He snatched it from\nArthur who was still holding it as if it was a two week dead lark\nand pulled it out of its cover.",
    "\"You press this button here you see and the screen lights up\ngiving you the index\"\n\nA screen, about three inches by four, lit up and characters began\nto flicker across the surface.",
    "\"You want to know about Vogons, so I enter that name so\" His\nfingers tapped some more keys.  \"And there we are\"\n\nThe words Vogon Constructor Fleets flared in green across the\nscreen.",
    "Ford pressed a large red button at the bottom of the screen and\nwords began to undulate across it.  At the same time, the book\nbegan to speak the entry as well in a still quiet measured voice.\n This is what the book said.\n\n \"Vogon Constructor Fleets.",
    "Here is what to do if you want to get\na lift from a Vogon: forget it.  They are one of the most\nunpleasant races in the Galaxy not actually evil, but bad\ntempered, bureaucratic, officious and callous.",
    "They wouldn't even\nlift a finger to save their own grandmothers from the Ravenous\nBugblatter Beast of Traal without orders signed in triplicate,\nsent in, sent back, queried, lost, found, subjected to public\ninquiry, lost again, and finally buried in soft peat and recycled\nas firelighters.",
    "\"The best way to get a drink out of a Vogon is to stick your\nfinger down his throat, and the best way to irritate him is to\nfeed his grandmother to the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal.",
    "\"On no account allow a Vogon to read poetry at you\"\n\nArthur blinked at it.\n\n \"What a strange book.  How did we get a lift then? \"\n\n\"That's the point, it's out of date now\" said Ford, sliding the\nbook back into its cover.",
    "\"I'm doing the field research for the\nNew Revised Edition, and one of the things I'll have to include\nis a bit about how the Vogons now employ Dentrassi cooks which\ngives us a rather useful little loophole\"\n\nA pained expression crossed Arthur's face.  \"But who are the\nDentrassi?",
    "\" he said.\n\n \"Great guys\" said Ford.  \"They're the best cooks and the best\ndrink mixers and they don't give a wet slap about anything else.\n And they'll always help hitch hikers aboard, partly because they\nlike the company, but mostly because it annoys the Vogons.",
    "Which\nis exactly the sort of thing you need to know if you're an\nimpoverished hitch hiker trying to see the marvels of the\nUniverse for less than thirty Altairan Dollars a day.  And that's\nmy job.  Fun, isn't it? \"\n\nArthur looked lost.",
    "\"It's amazing\" he said and frowned at one of the other\nmattresses.\n\n \"Unfortunately I got stuck on the Earth for rather longer than I\nintended\" said Ford.  \"I came for a week and got stuck for\nfifteen years\"\n\n\"But how did you get there in the first place then?",
    "\"\n\n\"Easy, I got a lift with a teaser\"\n\n\"A teaser? \"\n\n\"Yeah\"\n\n\"Er, what is.. \"\n\n\"A teaser?  Teasers are usually rich kids with nothing to do.  They\ncruise around looking for planets which haven't made interstellar\ncontact yet and buzz them\"\n\n\"Buzz them?",
    "\" Arthur began to feel that Ford was enjoying making\nlife difficult for him.\n \"Yeah\", said Ford, \"they buzz them.",
    "They find some isolated spot\nwith very few people around, then land right by some poor soul\nwhom no one's ever going to believe and then strut up and down in\nfront of him wearing silly antennae on their heads and making\nbeep beep noises.",
    "Rather childish really\" Ford leant back on the\nmattress with his hands behind his head and looked infuriatingly\npleased with himself.\n\n \"Ford\" insisted Arthur, \"I don't know if this sounds like a\nsilly question, but what am I doing here? \"\n\n\"Well you know that\" said Ford.",
    "\"I rescued you from the Earth\"\n\n\"And what's happened to the Earth? \"\n\n\"Ah.  It's been demolished\"\n\n\"Has it\" said Arthur levelly.\n\n \"Yes.",
    "It just boiled away into space\"\n\n\"Look\" said Arthur, \"I'm a bit upset about that\"\n\nFord frowned to himself and seemed to roll the thought around his\nmind.\n\n \"Yes, I can understand that\" he said at last.\n\n \"Understand that! \" shouted Arthur.  \"Understand that! \"\n\nFord sprang up.",
    "\"Keep looking at the book! \" he hissed urgently.\n\n \"What? \"\n\n\"Don't Panic\"\n\n\"I'm not panicking! \"\n\n\"Yes you are\"\n\n\"Alright so I'm panicking, what else is there to do? \"\n\n\"You just come along with me and have a good time.  The Galaxy's a\nfun place.",
    "You'll need to have this fish in your ear\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon? \" asked Arthur, rather politely he thought.\n\n Ford was holding up a small glass jar which quite clearly had a\nsmall yellow fish wriggling around in it.  Arthur blinked at him.",
    "He wished there was something simple and recognizable he could\ngrasp hold of.",
    "He would have felt safe if alongside the Dentrassi\nunderwear, the piles of Squornshellous mattresses and the man\nfrom Betelgeuse holding up a small yellow fish and offering to\nput it in his ear he had been able to see just a small packet of\ncorn flakes.",
    "He couldn't, and he didn't feel safe.\n\n Suddenly a violent noise leapt at them from no source that he\ncould identify.  He gasped in terror at what sounded like a man\ntrying to gargle whilst fighting off a pack of wolves.\n\n \"Shush! \" said Ford.",
    "\"Listen, it might be important\"\n\n\"Im...  important? \"\n\n\"It's the Vogon captain making an announcement on the T'annoy\"\n\n\"You mean that's how the Vogons talk? \"\n\n\"Listen! \"\n\n\"But I can't speak Vogon! \"\n\n\"You don't need to.",
    "Just put that fish in your ear\"\n\nFord, with a lightning movement, clapped his hand to Arthur's\near, and he had the sudden sickening sensation of the fish\nslithering deep into his aural tract.",
    "Gasping with horror he\nscrabbled at his ear for a second or so, but then slowly turned\ngoggle eyed with wonder.  He was experiencing the aural equivalent\nof looking at a picture of two black silhouetted faces and\nsuddenly seeing it as a picture of a white candlestick.",
    "Or of\nlooking at a lot of coloured dots on a piece of paper which\nsuddenly resolve themselves into the figure six and mean that\nyour optician is going to charge you a lot of money for a new\npair of glasses.",
    "He was still listening to the howling gargles, he knew that, only\nnow it had taken on the semblance of perfectly straightforward\nEnglish.\n\n This is what he heard...",

    "On arrival we will stay in dock for a\nseventy two hour refit, and no one's to leave the ship during\nthat time.  I repeat, all planet leave is cancelled.  I've just had\nan unhappy love affair, so I don't see why anybody else should\nhave a good time.",
    "Message ends\"\nThe noise stopped.\n\n Arthur discovered to his embarrassment that he was lying curled\nup in a small ball on the floor with his arms wrapped round his\nhead.  He smiled weakly.\n\n \"Charming man\" he said.",
    "\"I wish I had a daughter so I could\nforbid her to marry one.. \"\n\n\"You wouldn't need to\" said Ford.  \"They've got as much sex\nappeal as a road accident.",
    "No, don't move\" he added as Arthur\nbegan to uncurl himself, \"you'd better be prepared for the jump\ninto hyperspace.  It's unpleasantly like being drunk\"\n\n\"What's so unpleasant about being drunk? \"\n\n\"You ask a glass of water\"\n\nArthur thought about this.\n\n \"Ford\" he said.\n\n \"Yeah?",
    "\"\n\n\"What's this fish doing in my ear? \"\n\n\"It's translating for you.  It's a Babel fish.",
    "Look it up in the\nbook if you like\"\n\nHe tossed over The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy and then\ncurled himself up into a foetal ball to prepare himself for the\njump.\n\n At that moment the bottom fell out of Arthur's mind.\n\n His eyes turned inside out.",
    "His feet began to leak out of the top\nof his head.\n\n The room folded flat about him, spun around, shifted out of\nexistence and left him sliding into his own navel.\n\n They were passing through hyperspace.",
    "\"The Babel fish\" said The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy\nquietly, \"is small, yellow and leech like, and probably the\noddest thing in the Universe.  It feeds on brainwave energy not\nfrom its carrier but from those around it.",
    "It absorbs all\nunconscious mental frequencies from this brainwave energy to\nnourish itself with.  It then excretes into the mind of its\ncarrier a telepathic matrix formed by combining the conscious\nthought frequencies with nerve signals picked up from the speech\ncentres of the brain which has supplied them.",
    "The practical\nupshot of all this is that if you stick a Babel fish in your ear\nyou can instantly understand anything said to you in any form of\nlanguage.",

    "\"Meanwhile, the poor Babel fish, by effectively removing all\nbarriers to communication between different races and cultures,\nhas caused more and bloddier wars than anything else in the\nhistory of creation\"\n\nArthur let out a low groan.  He was horrified to discover that the\nkick through hyperspace hadn't killed him.",
    "He was now six light\nyears from the place that the Earth would have been if it still\nexisted.\n\n The Earth.\n\n Visions of it swam sickeningly through his nauseated mind.  There\nwas no way his imagination could feel the impact of the whole\nEarth having gone, it was too big.",
    "He prodded his feelings by\nthinking that his parents and his sister had gone.  No reaction.\n He thought of all the people he had been close to.  No reaction.",

    "But I'll mention it to my\naunt\"\n\nIf he said anything further after that it was lost.  The hatchway\nsealed itself tight, and all sound was lost but the faint distant\nhum of the ship's engines.",

    "\"So this is it\" said Arthur, \"we're going to die\"\n\n\"Yes\" said Ford, \"except...  no!  Wait a minute! \" he suddenly\nlunged across the chamber at something behind Arthur's line of\nvision.  \"What's this switch? \" he cried.\n\n \"What?  Where? \" cried Arthur twisting round.",
    "\"No, I was only fooling\" said Ford, \"we are going to die after\nall\"\n\nHe slumped against the wall again and carried on the tune from\nwhere he left off.",

    "The principle of generating small amounts of finite improbability\nby simply hooking the logic circuits of a Bambleweeny 57 Sub \nMeson Brain to an atomic vector plotter suspended in a strong\nBrownian Motion producer (say a nice hot cup of tea) were of\ncourse well understood and such generators were often used to\nbreak the ice at parties by making all the molecules in the\nhostess's undergarments leap simultaneously one foot to the left,\nin accordance with the Theory of Indeterminacy.",
    "Many respectable physicists said that they weren't going to stand\nfor this partly because it was a debasement of science, but\nmostly because they didn't get invited to those sort of parties.",
    "Another thing they couldn't stand was the perpetual failure they\nencountered in trying to construct a machine which could generate\nthe infinite improbability field needed to flip a spaceship\nacross the mind paralysing distances between the furthest stars,\nand in the end they grumpily announced that such a machine was\nvirtually impossible.",
    "Then, one day, a student who had been left to sweep up the lab\nafter a particularly unsuccessful party found himself reasoning\nthis way:\n\nIf, he thought to himself, such a machine is a virtual\nimpossibility, then it must logically be a finite improbability.",

    "The truth of the matter is that it would have been a great deal\nsimpler and more practical to build the cabin as an ordinary\nthree dimensional oblong rom, but then the designers would have\ngot miserable.",

    "\"\n\n\"Well I didn't know that did I? \"\n\"But what were you doing there? \"\n\n\"Looking about, you know\"\n\n\"He gatecrashed a party\" persisted Arthur, trembling with anger,\n\"a fancy dress party.. \"\n\n\"It would have to be, wouldn't it? \" said Ford.",

    "She watched the mice scurrying round the cage and running\nfuriously in their little plastic treadwheels till they occupied\nher whole attention.  Suddenly she shook herself and went back to\nthe bridge to watch over the tiny flashing lights and figures\nthat charted the ship's progress through the void.",

    "\"\n\n\"I think we just found what you came to look for\"\n\n\"Hey, yeah? \"\nFord gave up the attempt to sleep.  In the corner of his cabin was\na small computer screen and keyboard.",

It's at the exact coordinates you\npredicted\"\n\nZaphod heard a noise and looked up.\n\n \"Ford! \" he hissed.",
    "\"Hey, come and take a look at this\"\n\nFord went and had a look at it.  It was a series of figures\nflashing over a screen.\n\n \"You recognize those Galactic coordinates? \" said Zaphod.\n\n \"No\"\n\n\"I'll give you a clue.  Computer! \"\n\n\"Hi gang! \" enthused the computer.",
    "\"This is getting real sociable\nisn't it? \"\n\n\"Shut up\" said Zaphod, \"and show up the screens\"\n\nLight on the bridge sank.  Pinpoints of light played across the\nconsoles and reflected in four pairs of eyes that stared up at\nthe external monitor screens.\n\n There was absolutely nothing on them.",

One whole vast dark cloud\"\n\n\"And I was meant to recognize that from a blank screen?",
    "\"\n\n\"Inside a dark nebula is the only place in the Galaxy you'd see a\ndark screen\"\n\"Very good\"\n\nZaphod laughed.  He was clearly very excited about something,\nalmost childishly so.\n\n \"Hey, this is really terrific, this is just far too much!",
    "\"\n\n\"What's so great about being stuck in a dust cloud? \" said Ford.\n\n \"What would you reckon to find here? \" urged Zaphod.\n\n \"Nothing\"\n\n\"No stars?

    "Mighty starships plied their way between exotic suns, seeking\nadventure and reward amongst the furthest reaches of Galactic\nspace.",
    "In those days spirits were brave, the stakes were high,\nmen were real men, women were real women, and small furry\ncreatures from Alpha Centauri were real small furry creatures\nfrom Alpha Centauri.",
    "And all dared to brave unknown terrors, to\ndo mighty deeds, to boldly split infinitives that no man had\nsplit before and thus was the Empire forged.",
    "Many men of course became extremely rich, but this was perfectly\nnatural and nothing to be ashamed of because no one was really\npoor at least no one worth speaking of.",
    "And for all the richest\nand most successful merchants life inevitably became rather dull\nand niggly, and they began to imagine that this was therefore the\nfault of the worlds they'd settled on none of them was entirely\nsatisfactory: either the climate wasn't quite right in the later\npart of the afternoon, or the day was half an hour too long, or\nthe sea was exactly the wrong shade of pink.",
    "And thus were created the conditions for a staggering new form of\nspecialist industry: custom made luxury planet building.",
    "The home\nof this industry was the planet Magrathea, where hyperspatial\nengineers sucked matter through white holes in space to form it\ninto dream planets gold planets, platinum planets, soft rubber\nplanets with lots of earthquakes all lovingly made to meet the\nexacting standards that the Galaxy's richest men naturally came\nto expect.",
    "But so successful was this venture that Magrathea itself soon\nbecame the richest planet of all time and the rest of the Galaxy\nwas reduced to abject poverty.",
    "And so the system broke down, the\nEmpire collapsed, and a long sullen silence settled over a\nbillion worlds, disturbed only by the pen scratchings of scholars\nas they laboured into the night over smug little treaties on the\nvalue of a planned political economy.",
    "Magrathea itself disappeared and its memory soon passed into the\nobscurity of legend.\n\n In these enlightened days of course, no one believes a word of\nit.\n\n\n\n\n Arthur awoke to the sound of argument and went to the bridge.\n Ford was waving his arms about.",
    "\"You're crazy, Zaphod\" he was saying, \"Magrathea is a myth, a\nfairy story, it's what parents tell their kids about at night if\nthey want them to grow up to become economists, it's.. \"\n\n\"And that's what we are currently in orbit around\" insisted\nZaphod.",
    "\"Look, I can't help what you may personally be in orbit around\"\nsaid Ford, \"but this ship.. \"\n\n\"Computer! \" shouted Zaphod.\n\n \"Oh no.. \"\n\n\"Hi there!",
    "This is Eddie your shipboard computer, and I'm feeling\njust great guys, and I know I'm just going to get a bundle of\nkicks out of any programme you care to run through me\"\n\nArthur looked inquiringly at Trillian.  She motioned him to come\non in but keep quiet.",
    "\"Computer\" said Zaphod, \"tell us again what our present\ntrajectory is\"\n\"A real pleasure feller\" it burbled, \"we are currently in orbit\nat an altitude of three hundred miles around the legendary planet\nof Magrathea\"\n\n\"Proving nothing\" said Ford.",

    "I'm not arguing with anyone,\nit's just that I wouldn't know Magrathea from any other lump of\ncold rock.  Dawn's coming up if you want it\"\n\n\"OK, OK\" muttered Zaphod, \"let's at least give our eyes a good\ntime.  Computer! \"\n\n\"Hi there!  What can I..",
    "\"\n\n\"Just shut up and give us a view of the planet again\"\n\nA dark featureless mass once more filled the screens the planet\nrolling away beneath them.\n\n They watched for a moment in silence, but Zaphod was fidgety with\nexcitement.\n\n \"We are now traversing the night side..",
    "\" he said in a hushed\nvoice.  The planet rolled on.\n\n \"The surface of the planet is now three hundred miles beneath us.. \" he continued.  He was trying to restore a sense of occasion\nto what he felt should have been a great moment.  Magrathea!",
    "He\nwas piqued by Ford's sceptical reaction.  Magrathea!\n\n \"In a few seconds\" he continued, \"we should see...  there! \"\n\nThe moment carried itself.",
    "Even the most seasoned star tramp\ncan't help but shiver at the spectacular drama of a sunrise seen\nfrom space, but a binary sunrise is one of the marvels of the\nGalaxy.\n\n Out of the utter blackness stabbed a sudden point of blinding\nlight.",
    "It crept up by slight degrees and spread sideways in a\nthin crescent blade, and within seconds two suns were visible,\nfurnaces of light, searing the black edge of the horizon with\nwhite fire.  Fierce shafts of colour streaked through the thin\natmosphere beneath them.\n \"The fires of dawn...  !",
    "\" breathed Zaphod.  \"The twin suns of\nSoulianis and Rahm...  ! \"\n\n\"Or whatever\" said Ford quietly.\n\n \"Soulianis and Rahm! \" insisted Zaphod.\n\n The suns blazed into the pitch of space and a low ghostly music\nfloated through the bridge: Marvin was humming ironically because\nhe hated humans so much.",
    "As Ford gazed at the spectacle of light before them excitement\nburnt inside him, but only the excitement of seeing a strange new\nplanet, it was enough for him to see it as it was.",
    "It faintly\nirritated him that Zaphod had to impose some ludicrous fantasy on\nto the scene to make it work for him.  All this Magrathea nonsense\nseemed juvenile.",
    "Isn't it enough to see that a garden is\nbeautiful without having to believe that there are fairies at the\nbottom of it too?\n\n All this Magrathea business seemed totally incomprehensible to\nArthur.  He edged up to Trillian and asked her what was going on.",
    "\"I only know what Zaphod's told me\" she whispered.  \"Apparently\nMagrathea is some kind of legend from way back which no one\nseriously believes in.",
    "Bit like Atlantis on Earth, except that\nthe legends say the Magratheans used to manufacture planets\"\n\nArthur blinked at the screens and felt he was missing something\nimportant.  Suddenly he realized what it was.\n\n \"Is there any tea on this spaceship? \" he asked.",
    "More of the planet was unfolding beneath them as the Heart of\nGold streaked along its orbital path.",
    "The suns now stood high in\nthe black sky, the pyrotechnics of dawn were over, and the\nsurface of the planet appeared bleak and forbidding in the common\nlight of day grey, dusty and only dimly contoured.  It looked\ndead and cold as a crypt.",
    "From time to time promising features\nwould appear on the distant horizon ravines, maybe mountains,\nmaybe even cities but as they approached the lines would soften\nand blur into anonymity and nothing would transpire.",
    "The planet's\nsurface was blurred by time, by the slow movement of the thin\nstagnant air that had crept across it for century upon century.\n\n Clearly, it was very very old.\n\n A moment of doubt came to Ford as he watched the grey landscape\nmove beneath them.",
    "The immensity of time worried him, he could\nfeel it as a presence.  He cleared his throat.\n\n \"Well, even supposing it is.. \"\n\n\"It is\" said Zaphod.\n\n \"Which it isn't\" continued Ford.  \"What do you want with it\nanyway?  There's nothing there\"\n\"Not on the surface\" said Zaphod.",
    "\"Alright, just supposing there's something.  I take it you're not\nhere for the sheer industrial archaeology of it all.  What are you\nafter? \"\n\nOne of Zaphod's heads looked away.",
    "The other one looked round to\nsee what the first was looking at, but it wasn't looking at\nanything very much.\n\n \"Well\" said Zaphod airily, \"it's partly the curiosity, partly a\nsense of adventure, but mostly I think it's the fame and the\nmoney.. \"\n\nFord glanced at him sharply.",
    "He got a very strong impression that\nZaphod hadn't the faintest idea why he was there at all.\n\n \"You know I don't like the look of that planet at all\" said\nTrillian shivering.",
    "\"Ah, take no notice\" said Zaphod, \"with half the wealth of the\nformer Galactic Empire stored on it somewhere it can afford to\nlook frumpy\"\n\nBullshit, thought Ford.",
    "Even supposing this was the home of some\nancient civilization now gone to dust, even supposing a number of\nexceedingly unlikely things, there was no way that vast treasures\nof wealth were going to be stored there in any form that would\nstill have meaning now.  He shrugged.",
    "\"I think it's just a dead planet\" he said.\n\n \"The suspense is killing me\" said Arthur testily.",
    "Stress and nervous tension are now serious social problems in all\nparts of the Galaxy, and it is in order that this situation\nshould not in any way be exacerbated that the following facts\nwill now be revealed in advance.\n\n The planet in question is in fact the legendary Magrathea.",
    "The deadly missile attack shortly to be launched by an ancient\nautomatic defence system will result merely in the breakage of\nthree coffee cups and a micecage, the bruising of somebody's\nupper arm, and the untimely creation and sudden demise of a bowl\nof petunias and an innocent sperm whale.",
    "In order that some sense of mystery should still be preserved, no\nrevelation will yet be made concerning whose upper arm sustained\nthe bruise.  This fact may safely be made the subject of suspense\nsince it is of no significance whatsoever.",
    "After a fairly shaky start to the day, Arthur's mind was\nbeginning to reassemble itself from the shellshocked fragments\nthe previous day had left him with.",
    "He had found a Nutri Matic\nmachine which had provided him with a plastic cup filled with a\nliquid that was almost, but not quite, entirely unlike tea.  The\nway it functioned was very interesting.",
    "When the Drink button was\npressed it made an instant but highly detailed examination of the\nsubject's taste buds, a spectroscopic analysis of the subject's\nmetabolism and then sent tiny experimental signals down the\nneural pathways to the taste centres of the subject's brain to\nsee what was likely to go down well.",
    "However, no one knew quite\nwhy it did this because it invariably delivered a cupful of\nliquid that was almost, but not quite, entirely unlike tea.",
    "The\nNutri Matic was designed and manufactured by the Sirius\nCybernetics Corporation whose complaints department now covers\nall the major land masses of the first three planets in the\nSirius Tau Star system.\n\n Arthur drank the liquid and found it reviving.",
    "He glanced up at\nthe screens again and watched a few more hundred miles of barren\ngreyness slide past.  It suddenly occurred to him to ask a\nquestion which had been bothering him.\n\n \"Is it safe? \" he said.",
    "\"Magrathea's been dead for five million years\" said Zaphod, \"of\ncourse it's safe.  Even the ghosts will have settled down and\nraised families by now\" At which point a strange and\ninexplicable sound thrilled suddenly through the bridge a noise\nas of a distant fanfare; a hollow, reedy, insubstantial sound.",
    "It\npreceded a voice that was equally hollow, reedy and\ninsubstantial.  The voice said \"Greetings to you.. \"\n\nSomeone from the dead planet was talking to them.\n\n \"Computer! \" shouted Zaphod.\n\n \"Hi there! \"\n\n\"What the photon is it?",
    "\"\n\n\"Oh, just some five million year old tape that's being broadcast\nat us\"\n\n\"A what?  A recording? \"\n\n\"Shush! \" said Ford.  \"It's carrying on\"\n\nThe voice was old, courteous, almost charming, but was\nunderscored with quite unmistakable menace.",
    "\"This is a recorded announcement\" it said, \"as I'm afraid we're\nall out at the moment.  The commercial council of Magrathea thanks\nyou for your esteemed visit.. \"\n\n(\"A voice from ancient Magrathea! \" shouted Zaphod.  \"OK, OK\" said\nFord. )\n\n\"...",
    "but regrets\" continued the voice, \"that the entire planet\nis temporarily closed for business.  Thank you.  If you would care\nto leave your name and the address of a planet where you can be\ncontacted, kindly speak when you hear the tone\"\nA short buzz followed, then silence.",
    "\"They want to get rid of us\" said Trillian nervously.  \"What do\nwe do? \"\n\n\"It's just a recording\" said Zaphod.  \"We keep going.  Got that,\ncomputer? \"\n\n\"I got it\" said the computer and gave the ship an extra kick of\nspeed.\n\n They waited.",
    "After a second or so came the fanfare once again, and then the\nvoice.",
    "\"We would like to assure you that as soon as our business is\nresumed announcements will be made in all fashionable magazines\nand colour supplements, when our clients will once again be able\nto select from all that's best in contemporary geography\" The\nmenace in the voice took on a sharper edge.",
    "\"Meanwhile we thank\nour clients for their kind interest and would ask them to leave.\n Now\"\n\nArthur looked round the nervous faces of his companions.\n\n \"Well, I suppose we'd better be going then, hadn't we? \" he\nsuggested.\n\n \"Shhh! \" said Zaphod.",
    "\"There's absolutely nothing to be worried\nabout\"\n\n\"Then why's everyone so tense? \"\n\n\"They're just interested! \" shouted Zaphod.  \"Computer, start a\ndescent into the atmosphere and prepare for landing\"\n\nThis time the fanfare was quite perfunctory, the voice distinctly\ncold.",
    "\"It is most gratifying\" it said, \"that your enthusiasm for our\nplanet continues unabated, and so we would like to assure you\nthat the guided missiles currently converging with your ship are\npart of a special service we extend to all of our most\nenthusiastic clients, and the fully armed nuclear warheads are of\ncourse merely a courtesy detail.",
    "We look forward to your custom\nin future lives...  thank you\"\n\nThe voice snapped off.\n\n \"Oh\" said Trillian.\n\n \"Er.. \" said Arthur.\n\n \"Well? \" said Ford.\n\n \"Look\" said Zaphod, \"will you get it into your heads?  That's\njust a recorded message.  It's millions of years old.",
    "It doesn't\napply to us, get it? \"\n\"What\" said Trillian quietly, \"about the missiles? \"\n\n\"Missiles?  Don't make me laugh\"\n\nFord tapped Zaphod on the shoulder and pointed at the rear\nscreen.  Clear in the distance behind them two silver darts were\nclimbing through the atmosphere towards the ship.",
    "A quick change\nof magnification brought them into close focus two massively\nreal rockets thundering through the sky.  The suddenness of it was\nshocking.\n\n \"I think they're going to have a very good try at applying to\nus\" said Ford.\n\n Zaphod stared at them in astonishment.\n\n \"Hey this is terrific!",
    "\" he said.  \"Someone down there is trying to\nkill us! \"\n\n\"Terrific\" said Arthur.\n\n \"But don't you see what this means? \"\n\n\"Yes.  We're going to die\"\n\n\"Yes, but apart from that\"\n\n\"Apart from that? \"\n\n\"It means we must be on to something!",
    "\"\n\n\"How soon can we get off it? \"\n\nSecond by second the image of the missiles on the screen became\nlarger.  They had swung round now on to a direct homing course so\nthat all that could be seen of them now was the warheads, head\non.",
    "\"As a matter of interest\" said Trillian, \"what are we going to\ndo? \"\n\n\"Just keep cool\" said Zaphod.\n\n \"Is that all? \" shouted Arthur.\n\n \"No, we're also going to...  er...  take evasive action! \" said\nZaphod with a sudden access of panic.  \"Computer, what evasive\naction can we take?",
    "\"\n\n\"Er, none I'm afraid, guys\" said the computer.\n\n \"...  or something\" said Zaphod, \"...  er.. \" he said.\n\n \"There seems to be something jamming my guidance system\"\nexplained the computer brightly, \"impact minus forty five\nseconds.",
    "Please call me Eddie if it will help you to relax\"\n\nZaphod tried to run in several equally decisive directions\nsimultaneously.  \"Right! \" he said.  \"Er...  we've got to get manual\ncontrol of this ship\"\n\n\"Can you fly her? \" asked Ford pleasantly.\n\n \"No, can you?",
    "\"\n\n\"No\"\n\n\"Trillian, can you? \"\n\n\"No\"\n\n\"Fine\" said Zaphod, relaxing.  \"We'll do it together\"\n\n\"I can't either\" said Arthur, who felt it was time he began to\nassert himself.\n\n \"I'd guessed that\" said Zaphod.  \"OK computer, I want full manual\ncontrol now\"\n\n\"You got it\" said the computer.",
    "Several large desk panels slid open and banks of control consoles\nsprang up out of them, showering the crew with bits of expanded\npolystyrene packaging and balls of rolled up cellophane: these\ncontrols had never been used before.\n\n Zaphod stared at them wildly.",
    "\"OK, Ford\" he said, \"full retro thrust and ten degrees\nstarboard.  Or something.. \"\n\n\"Good luck guys\" chirped the computer, \"impact minus thirty\nseconds.. \"\n\nFord leapt to the controls only a few of them made any\nimmediate sense to him so he pulled those.",
    "The ship shook and\nscreamed as its guidance rocked jets tried to push it every which\nway simultaneously.  He released half of them and the ship span\nround in a tight arc and headed back the way it had come,\nstraight towards the oncoming missiles.",
    "Air cushions ballooned out of the walls in an instant as everyone\nwas thrown against them.  For a few seconds the inertial forces\nheld them flattened and squirming for breath, unable to move.",
    "Zaphod struggled and pushed in manic desperation and finally\nmanaged a savage kick at a small lever that formed part of the\nguidance system.\n\n The lever snapped off.  The ship twisted sharply and rocketed\nupwards.  The crew were hurled violently back across the cabin.",
    "Ford's copy of The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy smashed into\nanother section of the control console with the combined result\nthat the guide started to explain to anyone who cared to listen\nabout the best ways of smuggling Antarean parakeet glands out of\nAntares (an Antarean parakeet gland stuck on a small stick is a\nrevolting but much sought after cocktail delicacy and very large\nsums of money are often paid for them by very rich idiots who\nwant to impress other very rich idiots), and the ship suddenly\ndropped out of the sky like a stone.",
    "It was of course more or less at this moment that one of the crew\nsustained a nasty bruise to the upper arm.  This should be\nemphasized because, as had already been revealed, they escape\notherwise completely unharmed and the deadly nuclear missiles do\nnot eventually hit the ship.",
    "The safety of the crew is absolutely\nassured.\n\n \"Impact minus twenty seconds, guys.. \" said the computer.\n\n \"Then turn the bloody engines back on! \" bawled Zaphod.\n\n \"OK, sure thing, guys\" said the computer.",
    "With a subtle roar the\nengines cut back in, the ship smoothly flattened out of its dive\nand headed back towards the missiles again.\n\n The computer started to sing.\n\n \"When you walk through the storm.. \" it whined nasally, \"hold\nyour head up high..",
    "\"\n\nZaphod screamed at it to shut up, but his voice was lost in the\ndin of what they quite naturally assumed was approaching\ndestruction.\n\n \"And don't...  be afraid...  of the dark! \" Eddie wailed.",
    "The ship, in flattening out had in fact flattened out upside down\nand lying on the ceiling as they were it was now totally\nimpossible for any of the crew to reach the guidance systems.\n\n \"At the end of the storm.. \" crooned Eddie.",
    "The two missiles loomed massively on the screens as they\nthundered towards the ship.\n\n \"...  is a golden sky.. \"\n\nBut by an extraordinarily lucky chance they had not yet fully\ncorrected their flight paths to that of the erratically weaving\nship, and they passed right under it.",
    "\"And the sweet silver songs of the lark...  Revised impact time\nfifteen seconds fellas...  Walk on through the wind.. \"\n\nThe missiles banked round in a screeching arc and plunged back\ninto pursuit.\n\n \"This is it\" said Arthur watching them.  \"We are now quite\ndefinitely going to die aren't we?",
    "\"\n\n\"I wish you'd stop saying that\" shouted Ford.\n\n \"Well we are aren't we? \"\n\n\"Yes\"\n\"Walk on through the rain.. \" sang Eddie.\n\n A thought struck Arthur.  He struggled to his feet.\n\n \"Why doesn't anyone turn on this Improbability Drive thing? \" he\nsaid.",
    "\"We could probably reach that\"\n\n\"What are you crazy? \" said Zaphod.  \"Without proper programming\nanything could happen\"\n\n\"Does that matter at this stage? \" shouted Arthur.\n\n \"Though your dreams be tossed and blown.. \" sand Eddie.",
    "Arthur scrambled up on to one end of the excitingly chunky pieces\nof moulded contouring where the curve of the wall met the\nceiling.\n\n \"Walk on, walk on, with hope in your heart.. \"\n\n\"Does anyone know why Arthur can't turn on the Improbability\nDrive? \" shouted Trillian.",
    "\"And you'll never walk alone...  Impact minus five seconds, it's\nbeen great knowing you guys, God bless...  You'll ne...  ver...\n walk...  alone! \"\n\n\"I said\" yelled Trillian, \"does anyone know.. \"\n\nThe next thing that happened was a mid mangling explosion of\nnoise and light.",
    "And the next thing that happened after that was that the Heart of\nGold continued on its way perfectly normally with a rather\nfetchingly redesigned interior.  It was somewhat larger, and done\nout in delicate pastel shades of green and blue.",
    "In the centre a\nspiral staircase, leading nowhere in particular, stood in a spray\nof ferns and yellow flowers and next to it a stone sundial\npedestal housed the main computer terminal.",
    "Cunningly deployed\nlighting and mirrors created the illusion of standing in a\nconservatory overlooking a wide stretch of exquisitely manicured\ngarden.  Around the periphery of the conservatory area stood\nmarble topped tables on intricately beautiful wrought iron legs.",
    "As you gazed into the polished surface of the marble the vague\nforms of instruments became visible, and as you touched them the\ninstruments materialized instantly under your hands.",
    "Looked at\nfrom the correct angles the mirrors appeared to reflect all the\nrequired data readouts, though it was far from clear where they\nwere reflected from.  It was in fact sensationally beautiful.\n\n Relaxing in a wickerwork sun chair, Zaphod Beeblebrox said, \"What\nthe hell happened?",
    "\"\n\n\"Well I was just saying\" said Arthur lounging by a small fish\npool, \"there's this Improbability Drive switch over here.. \" he\nwaved at where it had been.  There was a potted plant there now.\n \"But where are we?",
    "\" said Ford who was sitting on the spiral\nstaircase, a nicely chilled Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster in his\nhand.\n\n \"Exactly where we were, I think..",
    "\" said Trillian, as all about\nthem the mirrors showed them an image of the blighted landscape\nof Magrathea which still scooted along beneath them.\n\n Zaphod leapt out of his seat.\n\n \"Then what's happened to the missiles? \" he said.\n\n A new and astounding image appeared in the mirrors.",
    "\"They would appear\" said Ford doubtfully, \"to have turned into a\nbowl of petunias and a very surprised looking whale..",
    "\"\n\n\"At an Improbability Factor\" cut in Eddie, who hadn't changed a\nbit, \"of eight million seven hundred and sixty seven thousand one\nhundred and twenty eight to one against\"\n\nZaphod stared at Arthur.\n\n \"Did you think of that, Earthman? \" he demanded.\n\n \"Well\" said Arthur, \"all I did was..",
    "\"\n\n\"That's very good thinking you know.  Turn on the Improbability\nDrive for a second without first activating the proofing screens.\n Hey kid you just saved our lives, you know that? \"\n\n\"Oh\" said Arthur, \"well, it was nothing really.. \"\n\n\"Was it? \" said Zaphod.",
    "\"Oh well, forget it then.  OK, computer,\ntake us in to land\"\n\n\"But.. \"\n\n\"I said forget it\"\n\nAnother thing that got forgotten was the fact that against all\nprobability a sperm whale had suddenly been called into existence\nseveral miles above the surface of an alien planet.",
    "And since this is not a naturally tenable position for a whale,\nthis poor innocent creature had very little time to come to terms\nwith its identity as a whale before it then had to come to terms\nwith not being a whale any more.",
    "This is a complete record of its thoughts from the moment it\nbegan its life till the moment it ended it.\n\n Ah...  ! What's happening?  it thought.\n\n Er, excuse me, who am I?\n\n Hello?\n Why am I here?  What's my purpose in life?",
    "What do I mean by who am I?\n\n Calm down, get a grip now...  oh!  this is an interesting\nsensation, what is it?  It's a sort of...  yawning, tingling\nsensation in my...  my...",
    "well I suppose I'd better start\nfinding names for things if I want to make any headway in what\nfor the sake of what I shall call an argument I shall call the\nworld, so let's call it my stomach."
