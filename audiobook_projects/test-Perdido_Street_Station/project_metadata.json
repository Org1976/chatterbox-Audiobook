And infinite gratitude to Mic Cheetham, who has helped me more than I can say.\n\nI don’t have space to thank all the writers who’ve influenced me, but I want to mention two whose work is a constant source of inspiration and astonishment. Therefore to M. John Harrison, and to the memory of Mervyn Peake, my humble and heartfelt gratitude. I could never have written this book without them.\n\n\n\n\n\n“I even gave up, for a while, stopping by the window of the room to look out at the lights and deep, illuminated streets. That’s a form of dying, that losing contact with the city like that.”\n\n\nPhilip K. Dick, We Can Build You",
