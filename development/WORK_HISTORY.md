- **Multi-Voice Normalization**: Batch normalize all character voices for consistency
- **Color-coded Status**: Visual feedback with professional styling
- **Soft Limiting**: Intelligent audio protection to prevent distortion

**Technical Implementation**:
- K-weighting filters for professional audio analysis
- RMS-based volume calculations with dB conversion
- Integrated into both single-voice and multi-voice workflows
- Real-time UI feedback with gradient styling
- Terminal logging for volume changes during processing

### 🔧 **Critical Bug Fixes**
- **App Launch Error**: Fixed `NameError: name 'apply_volume_preset' is not defined`
- **Function Order Issues**: Resolved definition order problems in large codebase
- **Component Name Mismatches**: Fixed UI component reference errors
- **Missing Dependencies**: Added required audio processing library imports

### 🎵 **Audio Processing Pipeline**
