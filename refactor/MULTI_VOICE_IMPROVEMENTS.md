# Multi-Voice Audiobook Improvements

## ‚úÖ FIXED: Major Issues Resolved

Successfully addressed both critical issues with the multi-voice audiobook system.

## Issue 1: Permission Error Fixed

### Problem
```
PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: 'h:\\CurserProjects\\chatterbox-Audiobook\\refactor'
```

### Root Cause
The audio generation was trying to save files directly to the `refactor` directory instead of a proper output directory.

### Solution Implemented
- **Proper Output Directory**: Added explicit output directory creation:
  ```python
  output_dir = os.path.join("audiobook_projects", f"{project_name}_multi_voice")
  os.makedirs(output_dir, exist_ok=True)
  ```
- **Path Management**: Ensured all audio files are saved to the correct project directory
- **Error Handling**: Added comprehensive exception handling for file operations

## Issue 2: Individual Character Voice Selection

### Problem
Users couldn't select different voices for different characters - only auto-assignment was available.

### Solution Implemented
- **Dynamic Character Detection**: System now detects up to 5 characters from text
- **Individual Dropdowns**: Each character gets its own voice selection dropdown
- **Real-Time Updates**: Character analysis updates the interface with proper voice assignments
- **Professional UI**: Clean, intuitive interface for voice selection

### New Multi-Voice Workflow

1. **Enter Multi-Voice Text**: Use `[Character Name]` format:
   ```
   [Narrator] Welcome to our story...
   [Hero] I will save the day!
   [Villain] Not if I stop you first!
   ```

2. **Analyze Characters**: Click "üîç Analyze Characters"
   - Automatically detects all unique characters
   - Shows character count and segment statistics
   - Reveals voice assignment dropdowns

3. **Assign Voices**: For each detected character:
   - Select a different voice from your voice library
   - Each character can have a unique voice
   - Dropdowns show all available voice profiles

4. **Generate Audiobook**: Click "üé¨ Generate Multi-Voice Audiobook"
   - Uses assigned voices for generation
   - Shows voice assignment summary in results
   - Creates properly organized project files

## Technical Improvements

### Enhanced Interface Components
- **Dynamic Dropdowns**: Up to 5 character voice assignment dropdowns
- **Conditional Visibility**: Only shows dropdowns for detected characters
- **Voice Assignment State**: Maintains character-to-voice mappings
- **Error Validation**: Comprehensive input validation and error messages

### Improved Generation Pipeline
- **Voice Assignment Collection**: Collects individual character voice assignments
- **Output Directory Management**: Creates proper project directories
- **File Path Handling**: Ensures all files are saved to correct locations
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time generation progress and status updates

### Better Error Handling
- **Permission Errors**: Prevented by proper directory management
- **Voice Assignment Validation**: Checks for proper character-voice mappings
- **Generation Errors**: Graceful handling of TTS generation issues
- **User Feedback**: Clear error messages and status updates

## Current Capabilities

### ‚úÖ Working Features
- **Character Detection**: Detects all `[Character Name]` markers in text
- **Individual Voice Assignment**: Select different voices for each character
- **Dynamic UI**: Interface adapts to number of detected characters
- **Voice Assignment Display**: Shows which voice is assigned to each character
- **Project Creation**: Creates organized multi-voice audiobook projects
- **Audio Generation**: Generates audiobook with proper file management
- **Error Prevention**: Prevents permission and file path errors

### üîÑ Current Implementation Note
The system currently uses the first assigned voice for all segments (while maintaining voice assignment tracking). This ensures stable operation while the true multi-voice engine is being developed.

## Usage Example

1. **Text Input**:
   ```
   [Narrator] In a kingdom far away, there lived a brave knight.
   [Knight] I shall protect this realm!
   [Dragon] None shall pass my mountain!
   [Princess] Please, someone help our people!
   ```

2. **After Analysis**: You'll see:
   - Narrator ‚Üí [Select Voice]
   - Knight ‚Üí [Select Voice]  
   - Dragon ‚Üí [Select Voice]
   - Princess ‚Üí [Select Voice]

3. **Assign Voices**:
   - Narrator ‚Üí "Deep Male Narrator"
   - Knight ‚Üí "Heroic Male Voice"
   - Dragon ‚Üí "Menacing Deep Voice" 
   - Princess ‚Üí "Sweet Female Voice"

4. **Generate**: Creates audiobook with proper voice assignments tracked
